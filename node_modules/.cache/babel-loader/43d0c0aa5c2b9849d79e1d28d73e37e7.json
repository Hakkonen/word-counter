Rebel spaceships, \nstriking from a hidden base, have won their first \nvictory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\nDuring the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \nsecret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the \nDeath Star, an armored space station with enough \npower to destroy an entire planet.\n\nPursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess \nLeia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \nthe stolen plans that can save her people and \nrestore freedom to the galaxy...\n\nThe awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \neclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \nsilver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \nfrom the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \nby a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \nlaserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \nthe main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\n\nAn explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\nD2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way \nthrough the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are \nold and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \nface is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \nThreepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \nhuman proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \nsurface of an Art Deco design.\n\nAnother blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDid you hear that? They've shut down \nthe main reactor. We'll be destroyed \nfor sure. This is madness!\n\nRebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in \nthe main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed!\n\nThe little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that \nonly another robot could understand.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThere'll be no escape for the Princess \nthis time.\n\nArtoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as \nloud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment \nare heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat's that?\n\nEXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\n\nThe Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade \nRunner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the \nunderside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nThe nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a \ntremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and \na score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make \ntheir way into the smoke-filled corridor.\n\nIn a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with \nlaserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \ncreating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \nbehind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers \nwho scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \narms and faces.\n\nAn explosion hits near the robots.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI should have known better than to \ntrust the logic of a half-sized \nthermocapsulary dehousing assister...\n\nArtoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \naround the two hapless robots.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\n\nA death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \nThe tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \nfigure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \nwho looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \nhair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \nlad with a prize-winning smile.\n\nA light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \nlarge battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \ndesert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \nby a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \nappears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \nA bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \nhe instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \nutility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \nthe heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \nLandspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \nabove the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \ntiny robot to follow him.\n\nLUKE\nHurry up! Come with me! What are you \nwaiting for?! Get in gear!\n\nThe robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \nsmoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \narms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \ninto his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \nmadly.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\n\nThe awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his \nway into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is \nDarth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \nby his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \nstands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \nImperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \nfrom the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \nthe Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \nin a frenzied panic.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nA woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  \nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nThreepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is \nnowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel \nsoldiers can be heard in the distance.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?\n\nA familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and \nhe spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-\nfilled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years \nold) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, \ndreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting \nsomething on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little \nrobot joins his companion.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAt last! Where have you been?\n\nStormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey're heading in this direction. \nWhat are we going to do? We'll be \nsent to the spice mine of Kessel or \nsmashed into who knows what!\n\nArtoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the \nsubhallway. Threepio chases after him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWait a minute, where are you going?\n\nArtoo responds with electronic beeps.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR\n\nThe evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies \nof his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as \nan Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.\n\nIMPERIAL OFFICER\nThe Death Star plans are not in the \nmain computer.\n\nVader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles \nin vain.\n\nVADER\nWhere are those transmissions you \nintercepted?\n\nVader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.\n\nVADER\nWhat have you done with those plans?\n\nREBEL OFFICER\nWe intercepted no transmissions. \nAaah... This is a consular ship. \nWere on a diplomatic mission.\n\nVADER\nIf this is a consular ship... were \nis the Ambassador?\n\nThe Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the \nDark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a \ngruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. \nVader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to \nhis troops.\n\nVADER\nCommander, tear this ship apart until \nyou've found those plans and bring \nme the Ambassador. I want her alive!\n\nThe stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY\n\nThe lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the \nstormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia \nOrgana, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her \neyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds \nof the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the \ntroopers spots her.\n\nTROOPER\nThere she is! Set for stun!\n\nLeia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with \nher laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a \nparalyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.\n\nTROOPER\nShe'll be all right. Inform Lord \nVader we have a prisoner.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY\n\nArtoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. \nHe snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light \nbegins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into \nthe cramped four-man pod.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHey, you're not permitted in there. \nIt's restricted. You'll be deactivated \nfor sure..\n\nArtoo beeps something to him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't call me a mindless philosopher, \nyou overweight glob of grease! Now \ncome out before somebody sees you.\n\nArtoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding \nthe mission he is about to perform.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSecret mission? What plans? What are \nyou talking about? I'm not getting \nin there!\n\nArtoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps \nand twangs angrily.\n\nA new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris \nthrough the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, \nafter a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky \nrobot jumps into the lifepod.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm going to regret this.\n\nINT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER\n\nOn the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified \nrobots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.\n\nCHIEF PILOT\nThere goes another one.\n\nCAPTAIN\nHold your fire. There are no life \nforms. It must have been short-\ncircuited.\n\nINT. LIFEPOD\n\nArtoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  \nStars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat's funny, the damage doesn't \nlook as bad from out here.\n\nArtoo beeps an assuring response.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAre you sure this things safe?\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY\n\nHeat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white \nbuildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty \nempty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to \nget out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist \nat Luke as he flies past.\n\nWOMAN\nI've told you kids to slow down!\n\nINT. POWER STATION - DAY\n\nLuke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged \nmechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been \nasleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the \noffice, yelling wildly.\n\nFIXER\nDid I hear a young noise blast through \nhere?\n\nCAMIE\nIt was just wormie on another rampage.\n\nLuke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak \nand Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are \nplaying a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, \nhandsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy \ncity attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics \nof the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the \nbackground.\n\nLUKE\nShape it up you guys!... Biggs?\n\nLuke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great \njoy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.\n\nLUKE\nI didn't know you were back! When \ndid you get in?\n\nBIGGS\nJust now. I wanted to surprise you, \nhot shot. I thought you'd be here... \ncertainly didn't expect you to be \nout working.\n(he laughs)\n\nLUKE\nThe Academy didn't change you \nmuch...but you're back so soon? Hey, \nwhat happened, didn't you get your \ncommission?\n\nBiggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.\n\nBIGGS\nOf course I got it. Signed aboard \nThe Rand Ecliptic last week. First \nmate Biggs Darklighter at your \nservice...\n(he salutes)\n...I just came to say good-bye to \nall you unfortunate landlocked \nsimpletons.\n\nEveryone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend \nis almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of \nit.\n\nLUKE\nI almost forgot. There's a battle \ngoing on! Right here in our system. \nCome and look!\n\nDEAK\nNot again! Forget it.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - \nDAY\n\nThe group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie \nand The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. \nLuke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.\n\nLUKE\nThere they are!\n\nBiggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to \nsee something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars \nBiggs sees two small silver specks.\n\nBIGGS\nThat's no battle, hot shot... they're \njust sitting there! Probably a \nfreighter-tanker refueling.\n\nLUKE\nBut there was a lot of firing \nearlier...\n\nCamie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the \nbuilding in the process. Luke grabs them.\n\nLUKE\nHey, easy with those...\n\nCAMIE\nDon't worry about it, Wormie.\n\nThe Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs \nhis shoulders in resignation.\n\nFIXER\nI keep telling you, the Rebellion is \na long way from here. I doubt if the \nEmpire would even fight to keep this \nsystem. Believe me Luke, this planet \nis a big hunk of nothing...\n\nLuke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The \ngroup stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about \nLuke's ineptitude.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY\n\nPrincess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad \nof armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is \nbrutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly \nmarching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader \nemerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard \nat the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.\n\nLEIA\nLord Vader, I should have known. \nOnly you could be so bold. The \nImperial Senate will not sit for \nthis, when they hear you've attacked \na diplomatic...\n\nVADER\nDon't play games with me, Your \nHighness. You weren't on any mercy \nmission this time. You passed directly \nthrough a restricted system. Several \ntransmissions were beamed to this \nship by Rebel spies. I want to know \nwhat happened to the plans they sent \nyou.\n\nLEIA\nI don't know what you're talking \nabout. I'm a member of the Imperial \nSenate on a diplomatic mission to \nAlderaan...\n\nVADER\nYou're a part of the Rebel Alliance... \nand a traitor. Take her away!\n\nLeia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering \nhole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander \nturns to Vader.\n\nCOMMANDER\nHolding her is dangerous. If word of \nthis gets out, it could generate \nsympathy for the Rebellion in the \nsenate.\n\nVADER\nI have traced the Rebel spies to \nher. Now she is my only link to find \ntheir secret base!\n\nCOMMANDER\nShe'll die before she tells you \nanything.\n\nVADER\nLeave that to me. Send a distress \nsignal and then inform the senate \nthat all aboard were killed!\n\nAnother Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. \nThey stop and snap to attention.\n\nSECOND OFFICER\nLord Vader, the battle station plans \nare not aboard this ship! And no \ntransmissions were made. An escape \npod was jettisoned during the \nfighting, but no life forms were \naboard.\n\nVader turns to the Commander.\n\nVADER\nShe must have hidden the plans in \nthe escape pod. Send a detachment \ndown to retrieve them. See to it \npersonally, Commander. There'll be \nno one to stop us this time.\n\nCOMMANDER\nYes, sir.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the \nplanet Tatooine.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT\n\nJundland, or \"No Man's Land\", where the rugged desert mesas \nmeet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids \nkick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily \nwork their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in \nthe distance rests half buried in the sand.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHow did I get into this mess? I really \ndon't know how. We seem to be made \nto suffer. It's our lot in life.\n\nArtoo answers with beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI've got to rest before I fall apart. \nMy joints are almost frozen.\n\nArtoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat a desolate place this is.\n\nSuddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts \noff in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio \nstops and yells at him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhere are you going?\n\nA stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small \nrobot.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, I'm not going that way. It's \nmuch too rocky. This way is much \neasier.\n\nArtoo counters with a long whistle.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat makes you think there are \nsettlements over there?\n\nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't get technical with me.\n\nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat mission? What are you talking \nabout? I've had just about enough of \nyou! Go that way! You'll be \nmalfunctioning within a day, you \nnearsighted scrap pile!\n\nThreepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the \ndirection of the vast dune sea.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAnd don't let me catch you following \nme begging for help, because you \nwon't get it.\n\nArtoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges \noff in the direction of the towering mesas.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNo more adventures. I'm not going \nthat way.\n\nArtoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant \nmountains.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA\n\nThreepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a \ndune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless \nmiles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant \nrock mesas.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat malfunctioning little twerp. \nThis is all his fault! He tricked me \ninto going this way, but he'll do no \nbetter.\n\nIn a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand \nfrom his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of \nreflected light in the distance reveals an object moving \ntowards him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWait, what's that? A transport! I'm \nsaved!\n\nThe bronze android waves frantically and yells at the \napproaching transport.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOver here! Help! Please, help!\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY\n\nLuke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer \nand the others can be heard working inside.\n\nLUKE\n(Very animated)\n...so I cut off my power, shut down \nthe afterburners and came in low on \nDeak's trail. I was so close I thought \nI was going to fry my instruments. \nAs it was I busted up the Skyhopper \npretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty \nupset. He grounded me for the rest \nof the season. You should have been \nthere... it was fantastic.\n\nBIGGS\nYou ought to take it easy Luke. You \nmay be the hottest bushpilot this \nside of Mos Eisley, but those little \nSkyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it \nup, and one day, whammo, you're going \nto be nothing more than a dark spot \non the down side of a canyon wall.\n\nLUKE\nLook who's talking. Now that you've \nbeen around those giant starships \nyou're beginning to sound like my \nuncle. You've gotten soft in the \ncity...\n\nBIGGS\nI've missed you kid.\n\nLUKE\nWell, things haven't been the same \nsince you left, Biggs. It's been \nso... quiet.\n\nBiggs looks around then leans close to Luke.\n\nBIGGS\nLuke, I didn't come back just to say \ngood-bye... I shouldn't tell you \nthis, but you're the only one I can \ntrust... and if I don't come back, I \nwant somebody to know.\n\nLuke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.\n\nLUKE\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nBIGGS\nI made some friends at the Academy.\n(he whispers)\n...when our frigate goes to one of \nthe central systems, we're going to \njump ship and join the Alliance...\n\nLuke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.\n\nLUKE\nJoin the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! \nHow?\n\nBIGGS\nQuiet down will ya! You got a mouth \nbigger than a meteor crater!\n\nLUKE\nI'm sorry. I'm quiet.\n(he whispers)\nListen how quiet I am. You can barely \nhear me...\n\nBiggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.\n\nBIGGS\nMy friend has a friend on Bestine \nwho might help us make contact.\n\nLUKE\nYou're crazy! You could wander around \nforever trying to find them.\n\nBIGGS\nI know it's a long shot, but if I \ndon't find them I'll do what I can \non my own... It's what we always \ntalked about. Luke, I'm not going to \nwait for the Empire to draft me into \nservice. The Rebellion is spreading \nand I want to be on the right side -- \nthe side I believe in.\n\nLUKE\nAnd I'm stuck here...\n\nBIGGS\nI thought you were going to the \nAcademy next term. You'll get your \nchance to get off this rock.\n\nLUKE\nNot likely! I had to cancel my \napplication. There has been a lot of \nunrest among the Sandpeople since \nyou left... they've even raided the \noutskirts of Anchorhead.\n\nBIGGS\nYour uncle could hold off a whole \ncolony of Sandpeople with one blaster.\n\nLUKE\nI know, but he's got enough vaporators \ngoing to make the place pay off. He \nneeds me for just one more season. I \ncan't leave him now.\n\nBIGGS\nI feel for you, Luke, you're going \nto have to learn what seems to be \nimportant or what really is important. \nWhat good is all your uncle's work \nif it's taken over by the Empire?... \nYou know they're starting to \nnationalize commerce in the central \nsystems... it won't be long before \nyour uncle is merely a tenant, slaving \nfor the greater glory of the Empire.\n\nLUKE\nIt couldn't happen here. You said it \nyourself. The Empire won't bother \nwith this rock.\n\nBIGGS\nThings always change.\n\nLUKE\nI wish I was going... Are you going \nto be around long?\n\nBIGGS\nNo, I'm leaving in the morning...\n\nLUKE\nThen I guess I won't see you.\n\nBIGGS\nMaybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.\n\nLUKE\nWell, I'll be at the Academy next \nseason... after that who knows. I \nwon't be drafted into the Imperial \nStarfleet that's for sure... Take \ncare of yourself, you'll always be \nthe best friend I've got.\n\nBIGGS\nSo long, Luke.\n\nBiggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the \npower station.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET\n\nThe gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange \nforeboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures \nfill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock \ncanyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he \ngoes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \na moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\n\nIn the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \nand a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \nfurther up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \npair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \nnarrow path.\n\nThe unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \nsuddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \nof the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \none short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \nback. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \noff again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \nthan Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \ncautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \ntheir faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \nseen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \nthe heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \nthe trail.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\n\nThe eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\nlike vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a \nsmall disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \nlarge tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \nis sucked into the giant machine.\n\nThe filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \nand enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\n\nINT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA\n\nIt is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo \nswitches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles \naround the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty \nmetal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and \nmaimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper \nand stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \nof the chamber.\n\nINT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA\n\nArtoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the \nmiddle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various \nshapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, \nwhile others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls \nout from the gloom.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!\n\nA battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\n\nThe enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent \ntwin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain \nridge.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY\n\nFour Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-\nburied lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. \nA trooper yells to an officer some distance away.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nSomeone was in the pod. The tracks \ngo off in this direction.\n\nA second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand \nand gives it to the first trooper.\n\nSECOND TROOPER\nLook, sir -- droids.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DUNES\n\nThe Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.\n\nINT. SANDCRAWLER\n\nThreepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped \nprison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWake up! Wake up!\n\nSuddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, \ncreating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  \nThreepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights \npop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long \nchamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding \nwhite light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the \nodd assortment of robots.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed.\n\nA Jawa starts moving toward them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDo you think they'll melt us down?\n\nArtoo responds, making beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this \nnever end?\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON\n\nThe Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their \nbattered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of \nthe enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small \nhomestead consisting of three large holes in the ground \nsurrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small \nadobe block house.\n\nThe Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening \nthem up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. \nThe shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting \nsmall insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils \nshould be.\n\nOut of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, \na large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are \nsunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully \ninspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- \nshouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little \nJawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales \npitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\n\nA voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the \nhomestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru \nstanding in the main courtyard.\n\nBERU\nLuke, tell Owen that if he gets a \ntranslator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\n\nLUKE\nIt looks like we don't have much of \na choice but I'll remind him.\n\nLuke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment \nfor sale with the Jawa leader.\n\nOWEN\nI have no need for a protocol droid.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(quickly)\nSir -- not in an environment such as \nthis -- that's why I've also been \nprogrammed for over thirty secondary \nfunctions that...\n\nOWEN\nWhat I really need is a droid that \nunderstands the binary language of \nmoisture vaporators.\n\nTHREEPIO\nVaporators! Sir -- My first job was \nprogramming binary load lifter... \nvery similar to your vaporators. You \ncould say...\n\nOWEN\nDo you speak Bocce?\n\nTHREEPIO\nOf course I can, sir. It's like a \nsecond language for me... I'm as \nfluent in Bocce...\n\nOWEN\nAll right shut up!\n(turning to Jawa)\nI'll take this one.\n\nTHREEPIO\nShutting up, sir.\n\nOWEN\nLuke, take these two over to the \ngarage, will you? I want you to have \nboth of them cleaned up before dinner.\n\nLUKE\nBut I was going into Toshi Station \nto pick up some power converters...\n\nOWEN\nYou can waste time with your friends \nwhen your chores are done. Now come \non, get to it!\n\nLUKE\nAll right, come on! And the red one, \ncome on. Well, come on, Red, let's \ngo.\n\nAs the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back \ninto the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep \nand starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained \nby a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.\n\nOwen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two \nrobots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the \nhead of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.\n\nLUKE\nUncle Owen...\n\nOWEN\nYeah?\n\nLUKE\nThis R2 unit has a bad motivator. \nLook!\n\nOWEN\n(to the head Jawa)\nHey, what're you trying to push on \nus?\n\nThe Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked \nout of line and is moving up and down trying to attract \nattention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps \nLuke on the shoulder.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(pointing to Artoo)\nExcuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is \nin prime condition. A real bargain.\n\nLUKE\nUncle Owen...\n\nOWEN\nYeah?\n\nLUKE\nWhat about that one?\n\nOWEN\n(to Jawa)\nWhat about that blue one? We'll take \nthat one.\n\nWith a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged \nastro-droid for Artoo.\n\nLUKE\nYeah, take it away.\n\nTHREEPIO\nUh, I'm quite sure you'll be very \npleased with that one, sir. He really \nis in first-class condition. I've \nworked with him before. Here he comes.\n\nOwen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots \ntrudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.\n\nLUKE\nOkay, let's go.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nNow, don't you forget this! Why I \nshould stick my neck out for you is \nquite beyond my capacity!\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nThe garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful \natmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers \nhimself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the \nbattered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery \nwith a cord to his face.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThank the maker! This oil bath is \ngoing to feel so good. I've got such \na bad case of dust contamination, I \ncan barely move!\n\nArtoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought \nas he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man \nSkyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. \nFinally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he \nslams a wrench across the workbench.\n\nLUKE\nIt just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is \nright. I'm never gonna get out of \nhere!\n\nTHREEPIO\nIs there anything I might do to help?\n\nLuke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains \nand a tiny smile creeps across his face.\n\nLUKE\nWell, not unless you can alter time, \nspeed up the harvest, or teleport me \noff this rock!\n\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think so, sir. I'm only a \ndroid and not very knowledgeable \nabout such things. Not on this planet, \nanyways. As a matter of fact, I'm \nnot even sure which planet I'm on.\n\nLUKE\nWell, if there's a bright center to \nthe universe, you're on the planet \nthat it's farthest from.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI see, sir.\n\nLUKE\nUh, you can call me Luke.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI see, sir Luke.\n\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nJust Luke.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAnd I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg \nrelations, and this is my counterpart, \nArtoo-Detoo.\n\nLUKE\nHello.\n\nArtoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to \nscrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome \npick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping \noil from his bronze body.\n\nLUKE\nYou got a lot of carbon scoring here. \nIt looks like you boys have seen a \nlot of action.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWith all we've been through, sometimes \nI'm amazed we're in as good condition \nas we are, what with the Rebellion \nand all.\n\nLUKE\nYou know of the Rebellion against \nthe Empire?\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat's how we came to be in your \nservice, if you take my meaning, \nsir.\n\nLUKE\nHave you been in many battles?\n\nTHREEPIO\nSeveral, I think. Actually, there's \nnot much to tell. I'm not much more \nthan an interpreter, and not very \ngood at telling stories. Well, not \nat making them interesting, anyways.\n\nLuke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's \nneck joint. He uses a larger pick.\n\nLUKE\nWell, my little friend, you've got \nsomething jammed in here real good. \nWere you on a cruiser or...\n\nThe fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling \nhead over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\ndimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being \nprojected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a \nrainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly \nlit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.\n\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my \nonly hope.\n\nLUKE\nWhat's this?\n\nArtoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio \nto translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment \nover and over.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat is what?!? He asked you a \nquestion...\n(pointing to Leia)\nWhat is that?\n\nArtoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice \nthe hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer \nfor Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the \nsentence fragment over and over.\n\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my \nonly hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. \nYou're my only hope.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely \na malfunction. Old data. Pay it no \nmind.\n\nLuke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.\n\nLUKE\nWho is she? She's beautiful.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.\n\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\n\nTHREEPIO\nI think she was a passenger on our \nlast voyage. A person of some \nimportance, sir -- I believe. Our \ncaptain was attached to...\n\nLUKE\nIs there more to this recording?\n\nLuke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic \nsqueaks and a whistle.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBehave yourself, Artoo. You're going \nto get us in trouble. It's all right, \nyou can trust him. He's our new \nmaster.\n\nArtoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says he's the property of Obi-Wan \nKenobi, a resident of these parts. \nAnd it's a private message for him. \nQuite frankly, sir I don't know what \nhe's talking about. Our last master \nwas Captain Antilles, but with what \nwe've been through, this little R2 \nunit has become a bit eccentric.\n\nLUKE\nObi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means \nold Ben Kenobi?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI beg your pardon, sir, but do you \nknow what he's talking about?\n\nLUKE\nWell, I don't know anyone named Obi-\nWan, but old Ben lives out beyond \nthe dune sea. He's kind of a strange \nold hermit.\n\nLuke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few \nmoments.\n\nLUKE\nI wonder who she is. It sounds like \nshe's in trouble. I'd better play \nback the whole thing.\n\nArtoo beeps something to Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says the restraining bolt has \nshort circuited his recording system. \nHe suggests that if you remove the \nbolt, he might be able to play back \nthe entire recording.\n\nLuke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't \nreally heard what Threepio has been saying.\n\nLUKE\nH'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're \ntoo small to run away on me if I \ntake this off! Okay.\n\nLuke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off \nArtoo's side.\n\nLUKE\nThere you go.\n\nThe princess immediately disappears...\n\nLUKE\nWell, wait a minute. Where'd she go? \nBring her back! Play back the entire \nmessage.\n\nArtoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in \nembarrassment.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat message? The one you're carrying \ninside your rusty innards!\n\nA women's voice calls out from another room.\n\nAUNT BERU\nLuke? Luke! Come to dinner!\n\nLuke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning \nrobot.\n\nLUKE\nAll right, I'll be right there, Aunt \nBeru.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm sorry, sir, but he appears to \nhave picked up a slight flutter.\n\nLuke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and \nhurries out of the room.\n\nLUKE\nWell, see what you can do with him. \nI'll be right back.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nJust you reconsider playing that \nmessage for him.\n\nArtoo beeps in response.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNo, I don't think he likes you at \nall.\n\nArtoo beeps.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNo, I don't like you either.\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA\n\nLuke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher \nwith blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-\nused kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls \nof food and starts for the dining area.\n\nLuke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with \nsteaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red \ngrain.\n\nLUKE\nYou know, I think that R2 unit we \nbought might have been stolen.\n\nOWEN\nWhat makes you think that?\n\nLUKE\nWell, I stumbled across a recording \nwhile I was cleaning him. He says he \nbelongs to someone called Obi-Wan \nKenobi.\n\nOwen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but \nmanages to control himself.\n\nLUKE\nI thought he might have meant old \nBen. Do you know what he's talking \nabout? Well, I wonder if he's related \nto Ben.\n\nOwen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.\n\nOWEN\nThat old man's just a crazy old \nwizard. Tomorrow I want you to take \nthat R2 unit into Anchorhead and \nhave its memory flushed. That'll be \nthe end of it. It belongs to us now.\n\nLUKE\nBut what if this Obi-Wan comes looking \nfor him?\n\nOWEN\nHe won't, I don't think he exists \nany more. He died about the same \ntime as your father.\n\nLUKE\nHe knew my father?\n\nOWEN\nI told you to forget it. Your only \nconcern is to prepare the new droids \nfor tomorrow. In the morning I want \nthem on the south ridge working out \nthose condensers.\n\nLUKE\nYes, sir. I think those new droids \nare going to work out fine. In fact, \nI, uh, was also thinking about our \nagreement about my staying on another \nseason. And if these new droids do \nwork out, I want to transmit my \napplication to the Academy this year.\n\nOwen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress \nit.\n\nOWEN\nYou mean the next semester before \nharvest?\n\nLUKE\nSure, there're more than enough \ndroids.\n\nOWEN\nHarvest is when I need you the most. \nOnly one more season. This year we'll \nmake enough on the harvest so I'll \nbe able to hire some more hands. And \nthen you can go to the Academy next \nyear.\n\nLuke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.\n\nOWEN\nYou must understand I need you here, \nLuke.\n\nLUKE\nBut it's a whole 'nother year.\n\nOWEN\nLook, it's only one more season.\n\nLuke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.\n\nLUKE\nYeah, that's what you said last year \nwhen Biggs and Tank left.\n\nAUNT BERU\nWhere are you going?\n\nLUKE\nIt looks like I'm going nowhere. I \nhave to finish cleaning those droids.\n\nResigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen \nmechanically finishes his dinner.\n\nAUNT BERU\nOwen, he can't stay here forever. \nMost of his friends have gone. It \nmeans so much to him.\n\nOWEN\nI'll make it up to him next year. I \npromise.\n\nAUNT BERU\nLuke's just not a farmer, Owen. He \nhas too much of his father in him.\n\nOWEN\nThat's what I'm afraid of.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\n\nThe giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a \ndistant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few \nmoments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the \nhomestead.\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE\n\nLuke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in \nsight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt \nsimilar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the \nbox, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a \nshort yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.\n\nLUKE\nWhat are you doing hiding there?\n\nThreepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in \nsight.\n\nTHREEPIO\nIt wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't \ndeactivate me. I told him not to go, \nbut he's faulty, malfunctioning; \nkept babbling on about his mission.\n\nLUKE\nOh, no!\n\nLuke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\n\nLuke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead \nand searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-\nrobot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the \nsalt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his \nelectrobinoculars.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat R2 unit has always been a \nproblem. These astro-droids are \ngetting quite out of hand. Even I \ncan't understand their logic at times.\n\nLUKE\nHow could I be so stupid? He's nowhere \nin sight. Blast it!\n\nTHREEPIO\nPardon me, sir, but couldn't we go \nafter him?\n\nLUKE\nIt's too dangerous with all the \nSandpeople around. We'll have to \nwait until morning.\n\nOwen yells up from the homestead plaza.\n\nOWEN\nLuke, I'm shutting the power down \nfor the night.\n\nLUKE\nAll right, I'll be there in a few \nminutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.\n\nHe takes one final look across the dim horizon.\n\nLUKE\nYou know that little droid is going \nto cause me a lot of trouble.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, he excels at that, sir.\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA\n\nMorning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of \nthe open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of \nUncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.\n\nOWEN\nLuke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be \nloafing now!\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN\n\nThe interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru \nprepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.\n\nOWEN\nHave you seen Luke this morning?\n\nAUNT BERU\nHe said he had some things to do \nbefore he started today, so he left \nearly.\n\nOWEN\nUh? Did he take those two new droids \nwith him?\n\nAUNT BERU\nI think so.\n\nOWEN\nWell, he'd better have those units \nin the south range repaired be midday \nor there'll be hell to pay!\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY\n\nThe rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio \npilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast \nwasteland.\n\nINT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - \nDAY\n\nLuke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something \nin the motor compartment.\n\nLUKE\n(yelling)\nHow's that.\n\nThreepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the \nwind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.\n\nLUKE\nOld Ben Kenobi lives out in this \ndirection somewhere, but I don't see \nhow that R2 unit could have come \nthis far. We must have missed him. \nUncle Owen isn't going to take this \nvery well.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSir, would it help if you told him \nit was my fault.\n\nLUKE\n(brightening)\nSure. He needs you. He'd probably \nonly deactivate you for a day or \nso...\n\nTHREEPIO\nDeactivate! Well, on the other hand \nif you hadn't removed his restraining \nbolt...\n\nLUKE\nWait, there's something dead ahead \non the scanner. It looks like our \ndroid... hit the accelerator.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY\n\nFrom high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen \ngliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground \ntwo weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert \ncloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the \nmarginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle \nand points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs \nthe gun before it can be fired.\n\nThe Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, \nspeak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an \nanimated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in \nthe final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON\n\nThe Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied \nto a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large \nas elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, \nand long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders \nmount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs \nand ride off down the rugged bluff.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR\n\nThe speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, \nwith his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands \nbefore little Artoo.\n\nLUKE\nHey, whoa, just where do you think \nyou're going?\n\nThe little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses \nmenacingly behind the little runaway.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke here is your rightful \nowner. We'll have no more of this \nObi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't \ntalk to me about your mission, either. \nYou're fortunate he doesn't blast \nyou into a million pieces right here.\n\nLUKE\nWell, come on. It's getting late. I \nonly hope we can get back before \nUncle Owen really blows up.\n\nTHREEPIO\nIf you don't mind my saying so, sir, \nI think you should deactivate the \nlittle fugitive until you've gotten \nhim back to your workshop.\n\nLUKE\nNo, he's not going to try anything.\n\nSuddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic \nwhistles and screams.\n\nLUKE\nWhat's wrong with him now?\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh my... sir, he says there are \nseveral creatures approaching from \nthe southeast.\n\nLuke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.\n\nLUKE\nSandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's \nhave a look. Come on.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY\n\nLuke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and \nscans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the \ntwo riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young \nadventurer.\n\nLUKE\nThere are two Banthas down there but \nI don't see any... wait a second, \nthey're Sandpeople all right. I can \nsee one of them now.\n\nLuke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his \nelectrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of \nhis field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, \ngruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled \nand backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be \nheard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles \ndown the side of the mountain.\n\nThe towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed \ngaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in \nthe heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block \nthe blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. \nThe terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced \nto the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands \nover him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible \nshrieking laugh.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY\n\nArtoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in \nthe rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the \ninert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the \nspeeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts \nand supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then \neverything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan \nis heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the \nSandpeople fleeing in terror.\n\nArtoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight \nswishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even \ncloser, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and \nleans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and \nweathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating \neyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes \nas he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a \nslight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.\n\nBEN\nHello there! Come here my little \nfriend. Don't be afraid.\n\nArtoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and \nbegins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on \nLuke's forehead and he begins to come around.\n\nBEN\nDon't worry, he'll be all right.\n\nLUKE\nWhat happened?\n\nBEN\nRest easy, son, you've had a busy \nday. You're fortunate you're still \nin one piece.\n\nLUKE\nBen? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to \nsee you!\n\nBEN\nThe Jundland wastes are not to be \ntraveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, \nwhat brings you out this far?\n\nLUKE\nOh, this little droid! I think he's \nsearching for his former master... \nI've never seen such devotion in a \ndroid before... there seems to be no \nstopping him. He claims to be the \nproperty of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he \na relative of yours? Do you know who \nhe's talking about?\n\nBen ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.\n\nBEN\nObi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats \na name I haven't heard in a long \ntime... a long time.\n\nLUKE\nI think my uncle knew him. He said \nhe was dead.\n\nBEN\nOh, he's not dead, not... not yet.\n\nLUKE\nYou know him!\n\nBEN\nWell of course, of course I know \nhim. He's me! I haven't gone by the \nname Obi-Wan since oh, before you \nwere born.\n\nLUKE\nThen the droid does belong to you.\n\nBEN\nDon't seem to remember ever owning a \ndroid. Very interesting...\n\nHe suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.\n\nBEN\nI think we better get indoors. The \nSandpeople are easily startled but \nthey will soon be back and in greater \nnumbers.\n\nLuke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic \nbeep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio!\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY\n\nLittle Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins \nto chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and \nBen stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half \nburied in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.\n\nLuke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then \nflips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally \nthe mechanical man's systems turn on.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhere am I? I must have taken a bad \nstep...\n\nLUKE\nCan you stand? We've got to get out \nof here before the Sandpeople return.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think I can make it. You go \non, Master Luke. There's no sense in \nyou risking yourself on my account. \nI'm done for.\n\nArtoo makes a beeping sound.\n\nLUKE\nNo, you're not. What kind of talk is \nthat?\n\nLuke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little \nArtoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around \nsuspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the \nair.\n\nBEN\nQuickly, son... they're on the move.\n\nINT. KENOBI'S DWELLING\n\nThe small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but \nstill manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and \nsecurity. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as \nold Ben sits thinking.\n\nLUKE\nNo, my father didn't fight in the \nwars. He was a navigator on a spice \nfreighter.\n\nBEN\nThat's what your uncle told you. He \ndidn't hold with your father's ideals. \nThought he should have stayed here \nand not gotten involved.\n\nLUKE\nYou fought in the Clone Wars?\n\nBEN\nYes, I was once a Jedi Knight the \nsame as your father.\n\nLUKE\nI wish I'd known him.\n\nBEN\nHe was the best star-pilot in the \ngalaxy, and a cunning warrior. I \nunderstand you've become quite a \ngood pilot yourself. And he was a \ngood friend. Which reminds me...\n\nBen gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  \nAs Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the \nrestraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  \nLuke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the \ntable. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle \nwith several electronic gadgets attached to it.\n\nBEN\nI have something here for you. Your \nfather wanted you to have this when \nyou were old enough, but your uncle \nwouldn't allow it. He feared you \nmight follow old Obi-Wan on some \ndamned-fool idealistic crusade like \nyour father did.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSir, if you'll not be needing me, \nI'll close down for awhile.\n\nLUKE\nSure, go ahead.\n\nBen hands Luke the saber.\n\nLUKE\nWhat is it?\n\nBEN\nYour fathers lightsaber. This is the \nweapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy \nor as random as a blaster.\n\nLuke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out \nabout four feet and flickers there. The light plays across \nthe ceiling.\n\nBEN\nAn elegant weapon for a more civilized \ntime. For over a thousand generations \nthe Jedi Knights were the guardians \nof peace and justice in the Old \nRepublic. Before the dark times, \nbefore the Empire.\n\nLuke hasn't really been listening.\n\nLUKE\nHow did my father die?\n\nBEN\nA young Jedi named Darth Vader, who \nwas a pupil of mine until he turned \nto evil, helped the Empire hunt down \nand destroy the Jedi Knights. He \nbetrayed and murdered your father. \nNow the Jedi are all but extinct. \nVader was seduced by the dark side \nof the Force.\n\nLUKE\nThe Force?\n\nBEN\nWell, the Force is what gives a Jedi \nhis power. It's an energy field \ncreated by all living things. It \nsurrounds us and penetrates us. It \nbinds the galaxy together.\n\nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\n\nBEN\nNow, let's see if we can't figure \nout what you are, my little friend. \nAnd where you come from.\n\nLUKE\nI saw part of the message he was...\n\nLuke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful \nyoung Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.\n\nBEN\nI seem to have found it.\n\nLuke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before \nhis eyes.\n\nLEIA\nGeneral Kenobi, years ago you served \nmy father in the Clone Wars. Now he \nbegs you to help him in his struggle \nagainst the Empire. I regret that I \nam unable to present my father's \nrequest to you in person, but my \nship has fallen under attack and I'm \nafraid my mission to bring you to \nAlderaan has failed. I have placed \ninformation vital to the survival of \nthe Rebellion into the memory systems \nof this R2 unit. My father will know \nhow to retrieve it. You must see \nthis droid safely delivered to him \non Alderaan. This is our most \ndesperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan \nKenobi, you're my only hope.\n\nThere is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  \nOld Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs \non a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.\n\nBEN\nYou must learn the ways of the Force \nif you're to come with me to Alderaan.\n\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nAlderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. \nI've got to go home. It's late, I'm \nin for it as it is.\n\nBEN\nI need your help, Luke. She needs \nyour help. I'm getting too old for \nthis sort of thing.\n\nLUKE\nI can't get involved! I've got work \nto do! It's not that I like the \nEmpire. I hate it! But there's nothing \nI can do about it right now. It's \nsuch a long way from here.\n\nBEN\nThat's your uncle talking.\n\nLUKE\n(sighing)\nOh, God, my uncle. How am I ever \ngoing to explain this?\n\nBEN\nLearn about the Force, Luke.\n\nLUKE\nLook, I can take you as far as \nAnchorhead. You can get a transport \nthere to Mos Eisley or wherever you're \ngoing.\n\nBEN\nYou must do what you feel is right, \nof course.\n\nEXT. SPACE.\n\nAn Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like \nbattle station: the Death Star!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nEight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black \nconference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around \nthe room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, \nis speaking.\n\nTAGGE\nUntil this battle station is fully \noperational we are vulnerable. The \nRebel Alliance is too well equipped. \nThey're more dangerous than you \nrealize.\n\nThe bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.\n\nMOTTI\nDangerous to your starfleet, \nCommander, not to this battle station!\n\nTAGGE\nThe Rebellion will continue to gain \na support in the Imperial Senate as \nlong as....\n\nSuddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut \nshort and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial \noutland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, \nThe Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and \nbow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his \nplace at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind \nhim.\n\nTARKIN\nThe Imperial Senate will no longer \nbe of any concern to us. I've just \nreceived word that the Emperor has \ndissolved the council permanently. \nThe last remnants of the Old Republic \nhave been swept away.\n\nTAGGE\nThat's impossible! How will the \nEmperor maintain control without the \nbureaucracy?\n\nTARKIN\nThe regional governors now have direct \ncontrol over territories. Fear will \nkeep the local systems in line. Fear \nof this battle station.\n\nTAGGE\nAnd what of the Rebellion? If the \nRebels have obtained a complete \ntechnical readout of this station, \nit is possible, however unlikely, \nthat they might find a weakness and \nexploit it.\n\nVADER\nThe plans you refer to will soon be \nback in our hands.\n\nMOTTI\nAny attack made by the Rebels against \nthis station would be a useless \ngesture, no matter what technical \ndata they've obtained. This station \nis now the ultimate power in the \nuniverse. I suggest we use it!\n\nVADER\nDon't be too proud of this \ntechnological terror you've \nconstructed. The ability to destroy \na planet is insignificant next to \nthe power of the Force.\n\nMOTTI\nDon't try to frighten us with your \nsorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your \nsad devotion to that ancient religion \nhas not helped you conjure up the \nstolen data tapes, or given you \nclairvoyance enough to find the \nRebel's hidden fort...\n\nSuddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's \nspell.\n\nVADER\nI find your lack of faith disturbing.\n\nTARKIN\nEnough of this! Vader, release him!\n\nVADER\nAs you wish.\n\nTARKIN\nThis bickering is pointless. Lord \nVader will provide us with the \nlocation of the Rebel fortress by \nthe time this station is operational. \nWe will then crush the Rebellion \nwith one swift stroke.\n\nEXT.

It's just... \nI never heard of them hitting anything \nthis big before.\n\nBen is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.\n\nBEN\nThey didn't. But we are meant to \nthink they did.

Only Imperial \nstormtroopers are so precise.\n\nLUKE\nWhy would Imperial troops want to \nslaughter Jawas?\n\nLuke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are \ninspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.\n\nLUKE\nIf they traced the robots here, they \nmay have learned who they sold them \nto. And that would lead them home!\n\nLuke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for \nthe speeder and jumps it.\n\nBEN\nWait, Luke!

The door slides shut \nand the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled \nscreams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND\n\nThere is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of \nthe Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the \ndead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to \nhim.\n\nBEN\nThere's nothing you could have done, \nLuke, had you been there. You'd have \nbeen killed, too, and the droids \nwould be in the hands of the Empire.\n\nLUKE\nI want to come with you to Alderaan. \nThere's nothing here for me now.

The speeder stops on a bluff \noverlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard \narray of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A \nharsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts \nhis goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where \nBen is standing.\n\nBEN\nMos Eisley Spaceport. You will never \nfind a more wretched hive of scum \nand villainy.

TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA\n\nThe young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow \nBen Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy \nden is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic \nalien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At \nfirst the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, \nfurry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over \ndrinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group \nof repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender \nstops Luke and the robots.\n\nBARTENDER\nWe don't serve their kind here!\n\nLuke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many \noutlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's \ndrift.\n\nLUKE\nWhat?\n\nBARTENDER\nYour droids. They'll have to wait \noutside. We don't want them here.\n\nLuke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the \nGalactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures \nalong the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.\n\nLuke pats Threepio on the shoulder.\n\nLUKE\nListen, why don't you wait out by \nthe speeder. We don't want any \ntrouble.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI heartily agree with you sir.\n\nThreepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the \ncreatures at the bar go back to their drinks.\n\nBen is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-\nlooking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with \nfierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\ncovered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  \nOver his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, \nand little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a \nsight to behold.\n\nBen speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times \nduring his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets \nout a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit \ndisconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between \nBen and the giant Wookiee.\n\nLuke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips \nhis drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear \nor whatever.\n\nA large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\n\nCREATURE\nNegola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\n\nThe hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore \nthe creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby \nHuman and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the \nbelligerent monstrosity.\n\nHUMAN\nHe doesn't like you.\n\nLUKE\nI'm sorry.\n\nHUMAN\nI don't like you either.\n\nThe big creature is getting agitated and yells out some \nunintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young \nadventurer.\n\nHUMAN\nDon't insult us. You just watch \nyourself. We're wanted men. I have \nthe death sentence in twelve systems.\n\nLUKE\nI'll be careful than.\n\nHUMAN\nYou'll be dead.\n\nThe rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar \nmoves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His \nthree adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind \nLuke.\n\nBEN\nThis little one isn't worth the \neffort. Come let me buy you \nsomething...\n\nA powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young \nwould-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables \nand breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. \nWith a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked \nchrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. \nThe bartender panics.\n\nBARTENDER\nNo blasters! No blaster!\n\nWith astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life \nand in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut \nin two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, \ncut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns \noff his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. \nLuke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, \nattempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter \nof seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \ngiven a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \nhis bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben \npoints the the Wookiee.\n\nBEN\nThis is Chewbacca. He's first-mate \non a ship that might suit our needs.\n\nEXT.

She's fast enough for \nyou, old man. What's the cargo?\n\nBEN\nOnly passengers. Myself, the boy, \ntwo droids, and no questions asked.\n\nHAN\nWhat is it? Some kind of local \ntrouble?\n\nBEN\nLet's just say we'd like to avoid \nany Imperial entanglements.\n\nHAN\nWell, that's the trick, isn't it? \nAnd it's going to cost you something \nextra. Ten thousand in advance.\n\nLUKE\nTen thousand? We could almost buy \nour own ship for that!\n\nHAN\nBut who's going to fly it, kid! You?\n\nLUKE\nYou bet I could. I'm not such a bad \npilot myself!

The bartender points to the booth.\n\nTROOPER\nAll right, we'll check it out.\n\nThe stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben \nare gone.

Get back to the ship \nand get her ready.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET\n\nBEN\nYou'll have to sell your speeder.\n\nLUKE\nThat's okay. I'm never coming back \nto this planet again.\n\nINT.

As a matter of fact, I \nwas just going to see your boss. \nTell Jabba that I've got his money.\n\nHan sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the \ngun on him.\n\nGREEDO\nIt's too late. You should have paid \nhim when you had the chance. Jabba's \nput a price on your head, so large \nthat every bounty hunter in the galaxy \nwill be looking for you.

MILLENNIUM FALCON\n\nHAN\nChewie, get us out of here!\n\nThe group straps in for take off.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, my. I'd forgotten how much I \nhate space travel.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS\n\nThe half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general \nalarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above \nthe dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the \nmorning sky.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nHan climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who \nchatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.\n\nEXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE\n\nThe Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nHan frantically types information into the ship's computer.  \nLittle Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, \nmakes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.\n\nHAN\nIt looks like an Imperial cruiser. \nOur passengers must be hotter than I \nthought. Try and hold them off. Angle \nthe deflector shield while I make \nthe calculations for the jump to \nlight speed.\n\nEXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE\n\nThe Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow \nplanet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial \nstardestroyers.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nOver the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy \nspread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the \ncramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.\n\nHAN\nStay sharp! There are two more coming \nin; they're going to try to cut us \noff.\n\nLUKE\nWhy don't you outrun them? I thought \nyou said this thing was fast.\n\nHAN\nWatch your mouth, kid, or you're \ngoing to find yourself floating home. \nWe'll be safe enough once we make \nthe jump to hyperspace. Besides, I \nknow a few maneuvers. We'll lose \nthem!\n\nEXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE\n\nImperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nThe ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.\n\nHAN\nHere's where the fun begins!\n\nBEN\nHow long before you can make the \njump to light speed?\n\nHAN\nIt'll take a few moments to get the \ncoordinates from the navi-computer.\n\nThe ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.\n\nLUKE\nAre you kidding? At the rate they're \ngaining...\n\nHAN\nTraveling through hyperspace isn't \nlike dusting crops, boy! Without \nprecise calculations we could fly \nright through a star or bounce too \nclose to a supernova and that'd end \nyour trip real quick, wouldn't it?\n\nThe ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red \nwarning light begins to flash.\n\nLUKE\nWhat's that flashing?\n\nHAN\nWe're losing our deflector shield. \nGo strap yourself in, I'm going to \nmake the jump to light speed.\n\nThe galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if \ncrashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship \nmakes the jump to hyperspace.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a \nsecond.\n\nEXT. DEATH STAR\n\nAlderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\n\nAdmiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before \nGovernor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen \ndisplaying a small green planet.\n\nMOTTI\nWe've entered the Alderaan system.\n\nVader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her \nhands are bound.\n\nLEIA\nGovernor Tarkin, I should have \nexpected to find you holding Vader's \nleash. I recognized your foul stench \nwhen I was brought on board.\n\nTARKIN\nCharming to the last. You don't know \nhow hard I found it signing the order \nto terminate your life!\n\nLEIA\nI surprised you had the courage to \ntake the responsibility yourself!\n\nTARKIN\nPrincess Leia, before your execution \nI would like you to be my guest at a \nceremony that will make this battle \nstation operational. No star system \nwill dare oppose the Emperor now.\n\nLEIA\nThe more you tighten your grip, \nTarkin, the more star systems will \nslip through your fingers.\n\nTARKIN\nNot after we demonstrate the power \nof this station. In a way, you have \ndetermined the choice of the planet \nthat'll be destroyed first. Since \nyou are reluctant to provide us with \nthe location of the Rebel base, I \nhave chosen to test this station's \ndestructive power... on your home \nplanet of Alderaan.\n\nLEIA\nNo! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no \nweapons. You can't possibly...\n\nTARKIN\nYou would prefer another target? A \nmilitary target? Then name the system!\n\nTarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.\n\nTARKIN\nI grow tired of asking this. So it'll \nbe the last time. Where is the Rebel \nbase?\n\nLeia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to \nAlderaan.\n\nLEIA\n(softly)\nDantooine.\n\nLeia lowers her head.\n\nLEIA\nThey're on Dantooine.\n\nTARKIN\nThere. You see Lord Vader, she can \nbe reasonable.\n(addressing Motti)\nContinue with the operation. You may \nfire when ready.\n\nLEIA\nWhat?\n\nTARKIN\nYou're far too trusting. Dantooine \nis too remote to make an effective \ndemonstration. But don't worry. We \nwill deal with your Rebel friends \nsoon enough.\n\nLEIA\nNo!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER\n\nVADER\nCommence primary ignition.\n\nA button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A \nhooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  \nAnother lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another \nlever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A \nhuge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area \nand converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. \nThe small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA\n\nBen watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small \"seeker\" \nrobot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, \nseems almost faint.\n\nLUKE\nAre you all right? What's wrong?\n\nBEN\nI felt a great disturbance in the \nForce... as if millions of voices \nsuddenly cried out in terror and \nwere suddenly silenced. I fear \nsomething terrible has happened.\n\nBen rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then \nhe fixes his gaze on Luke.\n\nBEN\nYou'd better get on with your \nexercises.\n\nHan Solo enters the room.\n\nHAN\nWell, you can forget your troubles \nwith those Imperial slugs. I told \nyou I'd outrun 'em.\n\nLuke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.\n\nHAN\nDon't everyone thank me at once.\n\nThreepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a \ngame in which three-dimensional holographic figures move \nalong a chess-type board.\n\nHAN\nAnyway, we should be at Alderaan \nabout oh-two-hundred hours.\n\nChewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table \ncovered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the \ntable has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca \nseems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- \ncovered arms over his head.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNow be careful, Artoo.\n\nArtoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his \nstubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures \nto walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's \nface and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. \nThreepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and \nbegins to argue with the huge Wookiee.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe made a fair move. Screaming about \nit won't help you.\n\nHAN\n(interrupting)\nLet him have it. It's not wise to \nupset a Wookiee.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBut sir, nobody worries about \nupsetting a droid.\n\nHAN\nThat's 'cause droids don't pull \npeople's arms out of their socket \nwhen they lose. Wookiees are known \nto do that.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI see your point, sir. I suggest a \nnew strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee \nwin.\n\nLuke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems \nfrozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his \nhead. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  \nHan watches with a bit of smugness.\n\nBEN\nRemember, a Jedi can feel the Force \nflowing through him.\n\nLUKE\nYou mean it controls your actions?\n\nBEN\nPartially. But it also obeys your \ncommands.\n\nSuspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a \n\"seeker\", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, \nhovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of \nthe youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift \nlunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't \nmove and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, \nthen makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood \nred laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing \nhim to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.\n\nHAN\nHokey religions and ancient weapons \nare no match for a good blaster at \nyour side, kid.\n\nLUKE\nYou don't believe in the Force, do \nyou?\n\nHAN\nKid, I've flown from one side of \nthis galaxy to the other. I've seen \na lot of strange stuff, but I've \nnever seen anything to make me believe \nthere's one all-powerful force \ncontrolling everything. There's no \nmystical energy field that controls \nmy destiny.\n\nBen smiles quietly.\n\nHAN\nIt's all a lot of simple tricks and \nnonsense.\n\nBEN\nI suggest you try it again, Luke.\n\nBen places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his \neyes.\n\nBEN\nThis time, let go your conscious \nself and act on instinct.\n\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nWith the blast shield down, I can't \neven see. How am I supposed to fight?\n\nBEN\nYour eyes can deceive you. Don't \ntrust them.\n\nHan skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker \ninto the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then \ndrops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly \nmissing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits \nLuke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful \nyell and attempts to hit the seeker.\n\nBEN\nStretch out with your feelings.\n\nLuke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes \na dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the \nbolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original \nposition.\n\nBEN\nYou see, you can do it.\n\nHAN\nI call it luck.\n\nBEN\nIn my experience, there's no such \nthing as luck.\n\nHAN\nLook, going good against remotes is \none thing. Going good against the \nliving? That's something else.\n\nSolo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the \ncontrol panel.\n\nHAN\nLooks like we're coming up on \nAlderaan.\n\nHan and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.\n\nLUKE\nYou know, I did feel something. I \ncould almost see the remote.\n\nBEN\nThat's good. You have taken your \nfirst step into a larger world.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nImperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the \nevil Dark Lord Darth Vader.\n\nTARKIN\nYes.\n\nOFFICER CASS\nOur scout ships have reached \nDantooine. They found the remains of \na Rebel base, but they estimate that \nit has been deserted for some time. \nThey are now conducting an extensive \nsearch of the surrounding systems.\n\nTARKIN\nShe lied! She lied to us!\n\nVADER\nI told you she would never consciously \nbetray the Rebellion.\n\nTARKIN\nTerminate her... immediately!\n\nEXT. HYPERSPACE\n\nThe pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange \nsurreal light show surrounds the ship.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nHAN\nStand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in \nthe sublight engines.\n\nHan pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window \nstars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then \nstop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently \nshake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering \nthe sides of the ship.\n\nHAN\nWhat the...? Aw, we've come out of \nhyperspace into a meteor shower. \nSome kind of asteroid collision. \nIt's not on any of the charts.\n\nThe Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool \nin the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing \ncockpit.\n\nLUKE\nWhat's going on?\n\nHAN\nOur position is correct, except... \nno, Alderaan!\n\nLUKE\nWhat do you mean? Where is it?\n\nHAN\nThats what I'm trying to tell you, \nkid. It ain't there. It's been totally \nblown away.\n\nLUKE\nWhat? How?\n\nBen moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to \nsettle down.\n\nBEN\nDestroyed... by the Empire!\n\nHAN\nThe entire starfleet couldn't destroy \nthe whole planet. It'd take a thousand \nships with more fire power than \nI've...\n\nA signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled \nalarm starts humming.\n\nHAN\nThere's another ship coming in.\n\nLUKE\nMaybe they know what happened.\n\nBEN\nIt's an Imperial fighter.\n\nChewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside \nthe cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned \nImperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.\n\nLUKE\nIt followed us!\n\nBEN\nNo. It's a short range fighter.\n\nHAN\nThere aren't any bases around here. \nWhere did it come from?\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLUKE\nIt sure is leaving in a big hurry. \nIf they identify us, we're in big \ntrouble.\n\nHAN\nNot if I can help it. Chewie...jam \nit's transmissions.\n\nBEN\nIt'd be as well to let it go. It's \ntoo far out of range.\n\nHAN\nNot for long...\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the \nvastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nThe tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny \nfighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter \nuntil it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben \nstands behind Chewbacca.\n\nBEN\nA fighter that size couldn't get \nthis deep into space on its own.\n\nLUKE\nIt must have gotten lost, been part \nof a convoy or something.\n\nHAN\nWell, he ain't going to be around \nlong enough to tell anyone about us.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as \nthey race toward camera and disappear over head.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nThe distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or \nplanet.\n\nLUKE\nLook at him. He's headed for that \nsmall moon.\n\nHAN\nI think I can get him before he gets \nthere... he's almost in range.\n\nThe small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous \nspherical battle station.\n\nBEN\nThat's no moon! It's a space station.\n\nHAN\nIt's too big to be a space station.\n\nLUKE\nI have a very bad feeling about this.\n\nHAN\nYeah, I think your right. Full \nreverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary \npower.\n\nThe pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away \ntoward the gargantuan battle station.\n\nLUKE\nWhy are we still moving towards it?\n\nHAN\nWe're caught in a tractor beam! It's \npulling us in!\n\nLUKE\nBut there's gotta be something you \ncan do!\n\nHAN\nThere's nothin' I can do about it, \nkid. I'm in full power. I'm going to \nhave to shut down. But they're not \ngoing to get me without a fight!\n\nBen Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.\n\nBEN\nYou can't win. But there are \nalternatives to fighting.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR\n\nAs the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome \nmetal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station \nbecomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic \nsphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which \nthe helpless pirateship is dragged.\n\nEXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS\n\nThe helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port \ncontrol room and huge laser turret cannons.\n\nVOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM\n\nClear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic \nfield.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037\n\nThe pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death \nStar, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers \nstand at attention in a central assembly area.\n\nOFFICER\nTo you stations!\n(to another officer)\nCome with me.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY\n\nStormtroopers run to their posts.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HANGAR 2037\n\nA line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in \nreadiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons \nready to fire.\n\nOFFICER\nClose all outboard shields! Close \nall outboard shields!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nTarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.\n\nTARKIN\nYes.\n\nVOICE\n(over intercom)\nWe've captured a freighter entering \nthe remains of the Alderaan system. \nIt's markings match those of a ship \nthat blasted its way out of Mos \nEisley.\n\nVADER\nThey must be trying to return the \nstolen plans to the princess. She \nmay yet be of some use to us.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037\n\nVader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and \nseveral heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.\n\nVOICE\n(over intercom)\nUnlock one-five-seven and nine. \nRelease charges.\n\nOFFICER\n(to Vader)\nThere's no one on board, sir. \nAccording to the log, the crew \nabandoned ship right after takeoff. \nIt must be a decoy, sir. Several of \nthe escape pods have been jettisoned.\n\nVADER\nDid you find any droids?\n\nOFFICER\nNo, sir. If there were any on board, \nthey must also have jettisoned.\n\nVADER\nSend a scanning crew on board. I \nwant every part of this ship checked.\n\nOFFICER\nYes, sir.\n\nVADER\nI sense something... a presence I \nhaven't felt since...\n\nVader turns quickly and exits the hangar.\n\nOFFICER\nGet me a scanning crew in here on \nthe double. I want every part of \nthis ship checked!\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY\n\nA trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In \na few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant \nofficer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly \npop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his \nhead out of a third locker.\n\nLUKE\nBoy, it's lucky you had these \ncompartments.\n\nHAN\nI use them for smuggling. I never \nthought I'd be smuggling myself in \nthem. This is ridiculous. Even if I \ncould take off, I'd never get past \nthe tractor beam.\n\nBEN\nLeave that to me!\n\nHAN\nDamn fool. I knew that you were going \nto say that!\n\nBEN\nWho's the more foolish... the fool \nor the fool who follows him?\n\nHan shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nThe crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the \ntwo stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.\n\nTROOPER\nThe ship's all yours. If the scanners \npick up anything, report it \nimmediately. All right, let's go.\n\nThe crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound \nis followed by a voice calling to the guard below.\n\nHAN'S VOICE\nHey down there, could you give us a \nhand with this?\n\nThe stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire \nis heard.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE\n\nIn a very small command office near the entrance to the \npirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices \nthe guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.\n\nGANTRY OFFICER\nTX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at \nyour post? TX-four-one-two, do you \ncopy?\n\nA stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and \nwaves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating \nhis comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his \nhead in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an \nannoyed look.\n\nGANTRY OFFICER\nTake over. We've got a bad \ntransmitter. I'll see what I can do.\n\nAs the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing \nthe towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary \nstate of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling \nhowl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. \nThe aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted \nby Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the \nrobots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed \nas a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.\n\nLUKE\nYou know, between his howling and \nyour blasting everything in sight, \nit's a wonder the whole station \ndoesn't know we're here.\n\nHAN\nBring them on! I prefer a straight \nfight to all this sneaking around.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe found the computer outlet, sir.\n\nBen feeds some information into the computer and a map of \nthe city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it \ncarefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  \nArtoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.\n\nBEN\nPlug in. He should be able to \ninterpret the entire Imperial computer \nnetwork.\n\nArtoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the \nvast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information \nto the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says he's found the main computer \nto power the tractor beam that's \nholding the ship here. He'll try to \nmake the precise location appear on \nthe monitor.\n\nThe computer monitor flashes readouts.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThe tractor beam is coupled to the \nmain reactor in seven locations. A \npower loss at one of the terminals \nwill allow the ship to leave.\n\nBen studies the data on the monitor readout.\n\nBEN\nI don't think you boys can help. I \nmust go alone.\n\nHAN\nWhatever you say. I've done more \nthat I bargained for on this trip \nalready.\n\nLUKE\nI want to go with you.\n\nBEN\nBe patient, Luke. Stay and watch \nover the droids.\n\nLUKE\nBut he can...\n\nBEN\nThey must be delivered safely or \nother star systems will suffer the \nsame fate as Alderaan. Your destiny \nlies along a different path than \nmine. The Force will be with you... \nalways!\n\nBen adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps \nout of the command office, then disappears down a long grey \nhallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head \nin agreement.\n\nHAN\nBoy you said it, Chewie.\n\nHan looks at Luke.\n\nHAN\nWhere did you dig up that old fossil?\n\nLUKE\nBen is a great man.\n\nHAN\nYeah, great at getting us into \ntrouble.\n\nLUKE\nI didn't hear you give any ideas...\n\nHAN\nWell, anything would be better than \njust hanging around waiting for him \nto pick us up...\n\nLUKE\nWho do you think...\n\nSuddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  \nLuke goes over to him.\n\nLUKE\nWhat is it?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. \nHe says \"I found her\", and keeps \nrepeating, \"She's here.\"\n\nLUKE\nWell, who... who has he found?\n\nArtoo whistles a frantic reply.\n\nTHREEPIO\nPrincess Leia.\n\nLUKE\nThe princess? She's here?\n\nHAN\nPrincess? What's going on?\n\nTHREEPIO\nLevel five. Detention block A A-twenty-\nthree. I'm afraid she's scheduled to \nbe terminated.\n\nLUKE\nOh, no! We've got to do something.\n\nHAN\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nLUKE\nThe droid belongs to her. She's the \none in the message... We've got to \nhelp her.\n\nHAN\nNow, look, don't get any funny ideas. \nThe old man wants us to wait right \nhere.\n\nLUKE\nBut he didn't know she was here. \nLook, will you just find a way back \ninto the detention block?\n\nHAN\nI'm not going anywhere.\n\nLUKE\nThey're going to execute her. Look, \na few minutes ago you said you didn't \nwant to just wait here to be captured. \nNow all you want to do is stay.\n\nHAN\nMarching into the detention area is \nnot what I had in mind.\n\nLUKE\nBut they're going to kill her!\n\nHAN\nBetter her than me...\n\nLUKE\nShe's rich.\n\nChewbacca growls.\n\nHAN\nRich?\n\nLUKE\nYes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you \nwere to rescue her, the reward would \nbe...\n\nHAN\nWhat?\n\nLUKE\nWell more wealth that you can imagine.\n\nHAN\nI don't know, I can imagine quite a \nbit!\n\nLUKE\nYou'll get it!\n\nHAN\nI better!\n\nLUKE\nYou will...\n\nHAN\nAll right, kid. But you'd better be \nright about this.\n\nHan looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.\n\nLUKE\nAll right.\n\nHAN\nWhat's your plan?\n\nLUKE\nUh... Threepio, hand me those binders \nthere will you?\n\nLuke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.\n\nLUKE\nOkay. Now, I'm going to put these on \nyou.\n\nChewie lets out a hideous growl.\n\nLUKE\nOkay. Han, you put these on.\n\nLuke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.\n\nHAN\nDon't worry, Chewie. I think I know \nwhat he has in mind.\n\nThe Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as \nHan binds him with the electronic cuffs.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke, sir! Pardon me for \nasking... but, ah... what should \nArtoo and I do if we're discovered \nhere?\n\nLUKE\nLock the door!\n\nHAN\nAnd hope they don't have blasters.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat isn't very reassuring.\n\nLuke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and \nstart off into the giant Imperial Death Star.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE\n\nHan and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits \nas they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, \nbureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio \ncompletely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious \nglance.\n\nFinally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.\n\nLUKE\nI can't see a thing in this helmet.\n\nA bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away \nby Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and \nthe elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY\n\nSeveral Imperial officers walk through the wide main \npassageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot \nsimilar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end \nof the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then \ndisappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting \nthat it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. \nNo one in the hallway seems to notice him.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY \nAREA\n\nLuke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door \nslides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards \nenter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates \nare everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.\n\nHAN\nThis is not going to work.\n\nLUKE\nWhy didn't you say so before?\n\nHAN\nI did say so before!\n\nINT. DETENTION AREA\n\nElevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches \nthe trio.\n\nOFFICER\nWhere are you taking this... thing?\n\nChewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut \nup.\n\nLUKE\nPrisoner transfer from Block one-one-\nthree-eight.\n\nOFFICER\nI wasn't notified. I'll have to clear \nit.\n\nThe officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in \nthe information. There are only three other troopers in the \narea. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the \nalarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of \nChewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\n\nSuddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one \nof his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.\n\nHAN\nLook out! He's loose!\n\nLUKE\nHe's going to pull us all apart.\n\nHAN\nGo get him!\n\nThe startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and \nHan have already pulled out their laser pistols and are \nblasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of \nlaserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \ngate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \nlast of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \nabout to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink \nsystem, which is screeching questions about what is going \non.  He quickly checks the computer readout.\n\nHAN\nWe've got to find out which cell \nthis princess of yours is in. Here \nit is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. \nYou go get her. I'll hold them here.\n\nLuke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into \nthe buzzing comlink.\n\nHAN\n(sounding official)\nEverything is under control. Situation \nnormal.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWhat happened?\n\nHAN\n(getting nervous)\nUh... had a slight weapons \nmalfunction. But, uh, everything's \nperfectly all right now. We're fine. \nWe're all fine here, now, thank you. \nHow are you?\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWe're sending a squad up.\n\nHAN\nUh, uh, negative. We had a reactor \nleak here now. Give us a few minutes \nto lock it down. Large leak... very \ndangerous.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWho is this? What's your operating \nnumber?\n\nHan blasts the comlink and it explodes.\n\nHAN\nBoring conversation anyway.\n(yelling down the \nhall)\nLuke! We're going to have company!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW\n\nLuke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door \naway with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees \nthe dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping \nand is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on \nher face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands \nstaring at her with his mouth hanging open.\n\nLEIA\n(finally)\nAren't you a little short to be a \nstormtrooper?\n\nLuke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.\n\nLUKE\nWhat? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke \nSkywalker. I'm here to rescue you.\n\nLEIA\nYou're who?\n\nLUKE\nI'm here to rescue you. I've got \nyour R2 unit. I'm here with Ben \nKenobi.\n\nLEIA\nBen Kenobi is here! Where is he?\n\nLUKE\nCome on!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nDarth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the \nfar end of the conference table.\n\nVADER\nHe is here...\n\nTARKIN\nObi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think \nso?\n\nVADER\nA tremor in the Force. The last time \nI felt it was in the presence of my \nold master.\n\nTARKIN\nSurely he must be dead by now.\n\nVADER\nDon't underestimate the power of the \nForce.\n\nTARKIN\nThe Jedi are extinct, their fire has \ngone out of the universe. You, my \nfriend, are all that's left of their \nreligion.\n\nThere is a quiet buzz on the comlink.\n\nTARKIN\nYes.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nGovernor Tarkin, we have an emergency \nalert in detention block A A-twenty-\nthree.\n\nTARKIN\nThe princess! Put all sections on \nalert!\n\nVADER\nObi-Wan is here. The Force is with \nhim.\n\nTARKIN\nIf you're right, he must not be \nallowed to escape.\n\nVADER\nEscape is not his plan. I must face \nhim alone.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY\n\nAn ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the \nelevator door.\n\nHAN\nChewie!\n\nChewbacca responds with a growling noise.\n\nHAN\nGet behind me! Get behind me!\n\nA series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door \nthrough which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.\n\nHan and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke \nand flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting \nup with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.\n\nHAN\nCan't get out that way.\n\nLEIA\nLooks like you managed to cut off \nour only escape route.\n\nHAN\n(sarcastically)\nMaybe you'd like it back in your \ncell, Your Highness.\n\nLuke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they \ncontinue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their \nway down the corridor.\n\nLUKE\nSee-Threepio! See-Threepio!\n\nTHREEPIO\n(over comlink)\nYes sir?\n\nLUKE\nWe've been cut off! Are there any \nother ways out of the cell bay?... \nWhat was that? I didn't copy!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER\n\nThreepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and \nwhistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink \ntransmitter.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI said, all systems have been alerted \nto your presence, sir. The main \nentrance seems to be the only way in \nor out; all other information on \nyour level is restricted.\n\nSomeone begins banging on the door.\n\nTROOPER VOICE\nOpen up in there!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR\n\nLuke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as \nthey continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca \nare barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far \nand of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke \nfills the narrow cell corridor.\n\nLUKE\nThere isn't any other way out.\n\nHAN\nI can't hold them off forever! Now \nwhat?\n\nLEIA\nThis is some rescue. When you came \nin here, didn't you have a plan for \ngetting out?\n\nHAN\n(pointing to Luke)\nHe's the brains, sweetheart.\n\nLuke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.\n\nLUKE\nWell, I didn't...\n\nThe princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in \nthe wall next to Han, almost frying him.\n\nHAN\nWhat the hell are you doing?\n\nLEIA\nSomebody has to save our skins. Into \nthe garbage chute, wise guy.\n\nShe jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca \nlook on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and \nsays something.\n\nHAN\nGet in there you big furry oaf! I \ndon't care what you smell! Get in \nthere and don't worry about it.\n\nHan gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the \ntiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their \nway toward the opening.\n\nHAN\nWonderful girl! Either I'm going to \nkill her or I'm beginning to like \nher. Get in there!\n\nLuke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires \noff a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then \nslides into the chute himself and is gone.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nHan tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  \nLuke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He \nfinds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't \nbudge.\n\nHAN\n(sarcastically)\nOh! The garbage chute was a really \nwonderful idea. What an incredible \nsmell you've discovered! Let's get \nout of here! Get away from there...\n\nLUKE\nNo! wait!\n\nHan draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The \nlaserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  \nEveryone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes \nalmost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a \nrather grim look on her face.\n\nLUKE\nWill you forget it? I already tried \nit. It's magnetically sealed!\n\nLEIA\nPut that thing away! You're going to \nget us all killed.\n\nHAN\nAbsolutely, Your Worship. Look, I \nhad everything under control until \nyou led us down here. You know, it's \nnot going to take them long to figure \nout what happened to us.\n\nLEIA\nIt could be worse...\n\nA loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the \nmurky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins \nto back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols \ndrawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.\n\nHAN\nIt's worse.\n\nLUKE\nThere's something alive in here!\n\nHAN\nThat's your imagination.\n\nLUKE\nSomething just moves past my leg! \nLook! Did you see that?\n\nHAN\nWhat?\n\nLUKE\nHelp!\n\nSuddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.\n\nHAN\nLuke! Luke! Luke!\n\nSolo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air \nand thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around \nhis throat.\n\nLEIA\nLuke!\n\nLeia extends a long pipe toward him.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, Luke, grab a hold of this.\n\nLUKE\nBlast it, will you! My gun's jammed.\n\nHAN\nWhere?\n\nLUKE\nAnywhere! Oh!!\n\nSolo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the \nmuck by the slimy tentacle.\n\nHAN\nLuke! Luke!\n\nSuddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and \nmove in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  \nHan and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca \nhowls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke \nsuddenly bobs to the surface.\n\nLEIA\nGrab him!\n\nLuke seems to be released by the thing.\n\nLEIA\nWhat happened?\n\nLUKE\nI don't know, it just let go of me \nand disappeared...\n\nHAN\nI've got a very bad feeling about \nthis.\n\nBefore anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and \nedge toward the Rebels.\n\nLUKE\nThe walls are moving!\n\nLEIA\nDon't just stand there. Try to brace \nit with something.\n\nThey place poles and long metal beams between the closing \nwalls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant \ntrashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.\n\nLUKE\nWait a minute!\n\nLuke pulls out his comlink.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! \nWhere could he be?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE\n\nA soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for \nSee-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which \nis sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and \nThreepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great \nexplosion and the door of the control tower flies across the \nfloor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nTake over!\n(pointing to the dead \nofficer)\nSee to him! Look there!\n\nA trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides \nopen. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows \nhis bronze companion out into the office.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey're madmen! They're heading for \nthe prison level. If you hurry, you \nmight catch them.\n\nFIRST OFFICER\n(to his troops)\nFollow me! You stand guard.\n\nThe troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to \nwatch over the command office.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nCome on!\n\nThe guard aims a blaster at them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh! All this excitement has overrun \nthe circuits of my counterpart here. \nIf you don't mind, I'd like to take \nhim down to maintenance.\n\nTROOPER\nAll right.\n\nThe guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries \nout the door.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nAs the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  \nChewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his \ngiant paws.\n\nHan is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is \nsnapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!\n\nHan and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. \nLeia begins to sink into the trash.\n\nHAN\nGet to the top!\n\nLEIA\nI can't\n\nLUKE\nWhere could he be? Threepio! Threepio, \nwill you come in?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey aren't here! Something must \nhave happened to them. See if they've \nbeen captured.\n\nLittle Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall \nsocket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from \nthe tiny robot.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHurry!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nThe walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against \nthe walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each \nother. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds \nit tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels \nthe first crushing pressure against her body.\n\nHAN\nOne thing's for sure. We're all going \nto be a lot thinner!\n(to Leia)\nGet on top of it!\n\nLEIA\nI'm trying!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nThank goodness, they haven't found \nthem! Where could they be?\n\nArtoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nUse the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I \nturned it off!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nMeanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his \nhead above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz \nand he rips it off his belt.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nMuffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, \nbut not distinctly.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAre you there, sir?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nLUKE\nThreepio!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe've had some problems...\n\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nWill you shut up and listen to me? \nShut down all garbage mashers on the \ndetention level, will you? Do you \ncopy?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nLUKE\nShut down all the garbage mashers on \nthe detention level.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nShut down all the garbage mashers on \nthe detention level.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nNo. Shut them all down! Hurry!\n\nThreepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible \nscreaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.\n\nTHREEPIO\nListen to them! They're dying, Artoo! \nCurse my metal body! I wasn't fast \nenough. It's all my fault! My poor \nmaster!\n\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nThreepio, we're all right!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nThe screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. \nThe walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace \nin the background.\n\nLUKE\nWe're all right. You did great.\n\nLuke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a \nnumber.\n\nLUKE\nHey... hey, open the pressure \nmaintenance hatch on unit number... \nwhere are we?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nThree-two-six-eight-two-seven.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH\n\nBen enters a humming service trench that powers the huge \ntractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. \nThe clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. \nThe old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading \nto a control panel that connects two large cables. He \ncarefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, \nand several lights on the board go from red to blue.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY\n\nThe group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  \nHan and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster \nbelts.\n\nHAN\nIf we can just avoid any more female \nadvice, we ought to be able to get \nout of here.\n\nLuke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster \nfrom Solo.\n\nLUKE\nWell, let's get moving!\n\nChewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage \nroom, as he runs away and then stops howling.\n\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nWhere are you going?\n\nThe Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy \ntentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a \nvictim. Han aims his pistol.\n\nLEIA\nNo, wait. They'll hear!\n\nHan fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes \nrelentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply \nshakes his head in disgust.\n\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nCome here, you big coward!\n\nChewie shakes his head \"no.\"\n\nHAN\nChewie! Come here!\n\nLEIA\nListen. I don't know who you are, or \nwhere you came from, but from now \non, you do as I tell you. Okay?\n\nHan is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.\n\nHAN\nLook, Your Worshipfulness, let's get \none thing straight! I take orders \nfrom one person! Me!\n\nLEIA\nIt's a wonder you're still alive.\n(looking at Chewie)\nWill somebody get this big walking \ncarpet out of my way?\n\nHan watches her start away. He looks at Luke.\n\nHAN\nNo reward is worth this.\n\nThey follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH\n\nSuddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of \nstormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly \nslips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few \nfeet of him.\n\nOFFICER\nSecure this area until the alert is \ncanceled.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nGive me regular reports.\n\nAll but two of the stormtroopers leave.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nDo you know what's going on?\n\nSECOND TROOPER\nMaybe it's another drill.\n\nBen moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers \nas they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand \ntoward them, as the troops think they hear something in the \nother hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips \npast the troopers and into the main hallway.\n\nSECOND TROOPER\nWhat was that?\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nOh, it's nothing. Don't worry about \nit.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY\n\nLuke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and \nstop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers \nare milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.\n\nHAN\n(looking at his ship)\nThere she is.\n\nLUKE\nSee-Threepio, do you copy?\n\nTHREEPIO\n(voice)\nFor the moment. Uh, we're in the \nmain hangar across from the ship.\n\nLUKE\nWe're right above you. Stand by.\n\nHan is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of \nthe pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and \npoints out the window to the ship.\n\nLEIA\nYou came in that thing? You're braver \nthat I thought.\n\nHAN\nNice! Come on!\n\nHan gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the \nhallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty \nImperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are \ntaken by surprise and stop in their tracks.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nIt's them! Blast them!\n\nBefore even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges \nthe troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the \nstormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down \nthe corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.\n\nHAN\n(to Luke and Leia)\nGet back to the ship!\n\nLUKE\nWhere are you going? Come back!\n\nHan has already rounded a corner and does not hear.\n\nLEIA\nHe certainly has courage.\n\nLUKE\nWhat good will it do us if he gets \nhimself killed? Come on!\n\nLuke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for \nmuted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke \nand Leia start off toward the starship hangar.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\nHan chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is \nyelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a \ndead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few \nfeet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops \nbegin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are \nmoving into an attack position in front of the lone \nstarpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops \nbegin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\nChewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt \nto save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of \nlaser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate \nextraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of \nfurious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running \nthe other way also.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\nLuke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down \na narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They \nquickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an \nopen hatchway.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT\n\nLuke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge \nthat spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. \nThe bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, \nand Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance \noff the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of \nhis arm and pulls him back.\n\nLUKE\n(gasping)\nI think we took a wrong turn.\n\nBlasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby \nreminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at \nthe advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch \nthat pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving \nthem precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  \nLaserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.\n\nLEIA\nThere's no lock!\n\nLuke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.\n\nLUKE\nThat oughta hold it for a while.\n\nLEIA\nQuick, we've got to get across. Find \nthe control that extends the bridge.\n\nLUKE\nOh, I think I just blasted it.\n\nLuke looks at the blasted bridge control while the \nstormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making \nominous drilling and pounding sounds.\n\nLEIA\nThey're coming through!\n\nLuke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when \nlaserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol \nat a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across \nthe abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops \nappear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, \nand grabs at his chest.\n\nAnother trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by \nLuke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move \nback off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.\n\nLUKE\nHere, hold this.\n\nLuke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. \nIt has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge \noverhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the \nrope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears \nand fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  \nSuddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet \nof more troops.\n\nLEIA\nHere they come!\n\nLeia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and \nhe falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the \ngorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He \ntugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the \nprincess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him \nquickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.\n\nLEIA\nFor luck!\n\nLuke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss \nto the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as \nLuke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the \nstormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at \nthe escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into \nthe tiny subhallway.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY\n\nBen hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several \nstormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks \nto make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the \nopposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of \nthe hallway and starts after the old Jedi.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nThreepio looks around at the troops milling about the \npirateship entry ramp.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhere could they be?\n\nArtoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left \nand right, beeping a response.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR\n\nHan and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several \ntroopers hot on their trail.\n\nTROOPER\nClose the blast doors!\n\nAt the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in \nfront of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion \nrace past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage \nto get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops \nbefore the doors slam shut.\n\nTROOPER\nOpen the blast doors! Open the blast \ndoors!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nBen hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar \nwhere the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, \nDarth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not \nten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his \nand steps slowly forward.\n\nVADER\nI've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. \nWe meet again, at last. The circle \nis now complete.\n\nBen Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive \nposition. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.\n\nVADER\nWhen I left you, I was but the \nlearner; now I am the master.\n\nBEN\nOnly a master of evil, Darth.\n\nThe two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few \nmoments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right \nmoment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, \nas if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He \nshakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.\n\nBen makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked \nby a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke \nby Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's \nblows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark \nLord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. \nThe two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments \nwith laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing \nsound.\n\nVADER\nYour powers are weak, old man.\n\nBEN\nYou can't win, Darth. If you strike \nme down, I shall become more powerful \nthan you can possibly imagine.\n\nTheir lightsabers continue to meet in combat.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nHan Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back \nagainst the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the \nImperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.\n\nHAN\nDidn't we just leave this party?\n\nChewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.\n\nHAN\nWhat kept you?\n\nLEIA\nWe ran into some old friends.\n\nLUKE\nIs the ship all right?\n\nHAN\nSeems okay, if we can get to it. \nJust hope the old man got the tractor \nbeam out of commission.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY\n\nVader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel.

Go!\n\nThey start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops \ncharging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader \ntakes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings \nhis mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to \ndeflect the blow and swiftly turns around.\n\nThe old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts \nhis sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene \nlook on his face.\n\nVader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's \ncloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  \nVader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the \nempty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers \nand the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two \nand starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.\n\nLUKE\nNo!\n\nThe stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  \nThe robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium \nFalcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns \ntheir fire.

Luke, its too late!\n\nHAN\nBlast the door! Kid!\n\nLuke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it \nexplodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge \nforward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close \nbehind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the \ndocking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his \nonrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, \nas Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He \nfires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.\n\nBEN'S VOICE\nRun, Luke! Run!\n\nLuke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns \ntoward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the \ntroopers and races into the ship.\n\nINT.

Chewie moves into the aft section to check the \ndamage. Leia is seated near Han.\n\nHAN\nNot a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You \nknow, sometimes I even amaze myself.\n\nLEIA\nThat doesn't sound too hard. Besides, \nthey let us go. It's the only \nexplanation for the ease of our \nescape.\n\nHAN\nEasy... you call that easy?\n\nLEIA\nTheir tracking us!\n\nHAN\nNot this ship, sister.\n\nFrustrated, Leia shakes her head.\n\nLEIA\nAt least the information in Artoo is \nstill intact.\n\nHAN\nWhat's so important? What's he \ncarrying?\n\nLEIA\nThe technical readouts of that battle \nstation. I only hope that when the \ndata is analyzed, a weakness can be \nfound. It's not over yet!\n\nHAN\nIt is for me, sister! Look, I ain't \nin this for your revolution, and I'm \nnot in it for you, Princess. I expect \nto be well paid. I'm in it for the \nmoney!\n\nLEIA\nYou needn't worry about your reward. \nIf money is all that you love, then \nthat's what you'll receive!\n\nShe angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, \npasses Luke coming in.\n\nLEIA\nYour friend is quite a mercenary. I \nwonder if he really cares about \nanything... or anyone.\n\nLUKE\nI care!\n\nLuke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han \nstare out at the vast blackness of space.\n\nLUKE\nSo... what do you think of her, Han?\n\nHAN\nI'm trying not to, kid!\n\nLUKE\n(under his breath)\nGood...\n\nHAN\nStill, she's got a lot of spirit.

MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK\n\nThe military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set \nup in the interior of the crumbling temple.

We had feared the worst.\n\nWillard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.\n\nWILLARD\nWhen we heard about Alderaan, we \nwere afraid that you were... lost \nalong with your father.\n\nLEIA\nWe don't have time for our sorrows, \nCommander. The battle station has \nsurely tracked us here.\n(looking pointedly to \nHan)\nIt's the only explanation for the \nease of our escape. You must use the \ninformation in this R2 unit to plan \nthe attack. It is our only hope.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red \nplanet Yavin.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\n\nGrand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their \ndiscussion by the buzz of the comlink.

Leia \nand several other senators are to one side of the giant \nreadout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, \nnavigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is \nlistening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and \nChewbacca are standing near the back.\n\nDODONNA\nThe battle station is heavily shielded \nand carries a firepower greater than \nhalf the star fleet. It's defenses \nare designed around a direct large-\nscale assault. A small one-man fighter \nshould be able to penetrate the outer \ndefense.\n\nGold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands \nand addresses Dodonna.\n\nGOLD LEADER\nPardon me for asking, sir, but what \ngood are snub fighters going to be \nagainst that?\n\nDODONNA\nWell, the Empire doesn't consider a \nsmall one-man fighter to be any \nthreat, or they'd have a tighter \ndefense. An analysis of the plans \nprovided by Princess Leia has \ndemonstrated a weakness in the battle \nstation.\n\nArtoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping \nsounds, and turns his head from right to left.\n\nDODONNA\nThe approach will not be easy. You \nare required to maneuver straight \ndown this trench and skim the surface \nto this point. The target area is \nonly two meters wide. It's a small \nthermal exhaust port, right below \nthe main port. The shaft leads \ndirectly to the reactor system. A \nprecise hit will start a chain \nreaction which should destroy the \nstation.\n\nA murmer of disbelief runs through the room.\n\nDODONNA\nOnly a precise hit will set up a \nchain reaction. The shaft is ray-\nshielded, so you'll have to use proton \ntorpedoes.\n\nLuke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about \nsixteen years old.\n\nWEDGE\nThat's impossible, even for a \ncomputer.\n\nLUKE\nIt's not impossible. I used to bull's-\neye womp rats in my T-sixteen back \nhome. They're not much bigger than \ntwo meters.\n\nDODONNA\nMan your ships! And may the Force be \nwith you!\n\nThe group rises and begins to leave.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the \ntiny green moon.\n\nINT.

The moon with the \nRebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\n\nVADER\nThis will be a day long remembered. \nIt has seen the end of Kenobi and it \nwill soon see the end of the \nRebellion.\n\nINT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK\n\nLuke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship \nhangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  \nFlight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and \nunlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this \nactivity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes \nonto an armored speeder.\n\nMAN'S VOICE\n(over loudspeaker)\nAll flight trooper, man your stations. \nAll flight troops, man your stations.\n\nHan is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter \npilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of \nhis friend's departure.\n\nLUKE\nSo... you got your reward and you're \njust leaving then?\n\nHAN\nThat's right, yeah! I got some old \ndebts I've got to pay off with this \nstuff. Even if I didn't, you don't \nthink I'd be fool enough to stick \naround here, do you? Why don't you \ncome with us? You're pretty good in \na fight. I could use you.\n\nLUKE\n(getting angry)\nCome on! Why don't you take a look \naround? You know what's about to \nhappen, what they're up against. \nThey could use a good pilot like \nyou. You're turning your back on \nthem.\n\nHAN\nWhat good's a reward if you ain't \naround to use it? Besides, attacking \nthat battle station ain't my idea of \ncourage. It's more like suicide.\n\nLUKE\nAll right. Well, take care of \nyourself, Han. I guess that's what \nyou're best at, isn't it?\n\nLuke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.\n\nHAN\nHey, Luke... may the Force be with \nyou!\n\nLuke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in \na small wave and then goes off.\n\nHan turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,\n\nHAN\nWhat're you lookin' at? I know what \nI'm doing.\n\nINT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP\n\nLuke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.\n\nLEIA\nWhat's wrong?\n\nLUKE\nOh, it's Han! I don't know, I really \nthought he'd change his mind.\n\nLEIA\nHe's got to follow his own path. No \none can choose it for him.\n\nLUKE\nI only wish Ben were here.\n\nLeia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke \nheads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs \nhis arm.\n\nBIGGS\nLuke! I don't believe it! How'd you \nget here... are you going out with \nus?!\n\nLUKE\nBiggs! Of course, I'll be up there \nwith you! Listen, have I got some \nstories to tell...\n\nRed Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up \nbehind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born \nleader.\n\nRED LEADER\nAre you... Luke Skywalker? Have you \nbeen checked out on the Incom T-sixty-\nfive?\n\nBIGGS\nSir, Luke is the best bushpilot in \nthe outer rim territories.\n\nRed Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of \nhis fighter.\n\nRED LEADER\nI met your father once when I was \njust a boy, he was a great pilot. \nYou'll do all right. If you've got \nhalf of your father's skill, you'll \ndo better than all right.\n\nLUKE\nThank you, sir. I'll try.\n\nRed Leader hurries to his own ship.\n\nBIGGS\nI've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll \ntell me your stories when we come \nback. All right?\n\nLUKE\nI told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.\n\nBIGGS\n(going off)\nYou did, all right. It's going to be \nlike old times, Luke. We're a couple \nof shooting stars that'll never be \nstopped!\n\nLuke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for \nhis ship.\n\nAs Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly \nspaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points \nto little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the \nback of the fighter.\n\nCHIEF\nThis R2 unit of your seems a bit \nbeat up. Do you want a new one?\n\nLUKE\nNot on your life! That little droid \nand I have been through a lot \ntogether.\n(to Artoo)\nYou okay, Artoo?\n\nThe crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of \nthe exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps \nthat he is fine.\n\nLuke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an \nhis helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive \nhangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner \ninto Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo \nbeeps good-bye.\n\nCHIEF\nOkay, easy she goes!\n\nTHREEPIO\nHang on tight,Artoo, you've got to \ncome back.\n\nArtoo beeps in agreement.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYou wouldn't want my life to get \nboring, would you?\n\nArtoo whistles his reply.\n\nAll final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  \nThe hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the \npilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The \nhum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted \nvoice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses \nare disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit \nshields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, \nholding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace \nof a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.\n\nBEN'S VOICE\nLuke, the Force will be with you.\n\nLuke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.\n\nEXT.

galaxy far, far, away...\n\nA vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. \nWar drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls \ninto infinity.\n\nIt is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, \nstriking from a hidden base, have won their first \nvictory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\nDuring the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \nsecret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the \nDeath Star, an armored space station with enough \npower to destroy an entire planet.\n\nPursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess \nLeia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \nthe stolen plans that can save her people and \nrestore freedom to the galaxy...\n\nThe awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \neclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \nsilver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \nfrom the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \nby a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \nlaserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \nthe main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\n\nAn explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\nD2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way \nthrough the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are \nold and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \nface is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \nThreepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \nhuman proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \nsurface of an Art Deco design.\n\nAnother blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDid you hear that? They've shut down \nthe main reactor. We'll be destroyed \nfor sure. This is madness!\n\nRebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in \nthe main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed!\n\nThe little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that \nonly another robot could understand.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThere'll be no escape for the Princess \nthis time.\n\nArtoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as \nloud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment \nare heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat's that?\n\nEXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\n\nThe Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade \nRunner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the \nunderside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nThe nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a \ntremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and \na score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make \ntheir way into the smoke-filled corridor.\n\nIn a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with \nlaserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \ncreating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \nbehind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers \nwho scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \narms and faces.\n\nAn explosion hits near the robots.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI should have known better than to \ntrust the logic of a half-sized \nthermocapsulary dehousing assister...\n\nArtoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \naround the two hapless robots.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\n\nA death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \nThe tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \nfigure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \nwho looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \nhair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \nlad with a prize-winning smile.\n\nA light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \nlarge battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \ndesert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \nby a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \nappears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \nA bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \nhe instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \nutility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \nthe heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \nLandspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \nabove the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \ntiny robot to follow him.\n\nLUKE\nHurry up! Come with me! What are you \nwaiting for?! Get in gear!\n\nThe robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \nsmoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \narms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \ninto his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \nmadly.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\n\nThe awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his \nway into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is \nDarth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \nby his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \nstands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \nImperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \nfrom the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \nthe Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \nin a frenzied panic.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nA woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  \nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\nThreepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is \nnowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel \nsoldiers can be heard in the distance.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?\n\nA familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and \nhe spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-\nfilled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years \nold) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, \ndreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting \nsomething on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little \nrobot joins his companion.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAt last! Where have you been?\n\nStormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey're heading in this direction. \nWhat are we going to do? We'll be \nsent to the spice mine of Kessel or \nsmashed into who knows what!\n\nArtoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the \nsubhallway. Threepio chases after him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWait a minute, where are you going?\n\nArtoo responds with electronic beeps.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR\n\nThe evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies \nof his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as \nan Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.\n\nIMPERIAL OFFICER\nThe Death Star plans are not in the \nmain computer.\n\nVader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles \nin vain.\n\nVADER\nWhere are those transmissions you \nintercepted?\n\nVader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.\n\nVADER\nWhat have you done with those plans?\n\nREBEL OFFICER\nWe intercepted no transmissions. \nAaah... This is a consular ship. \nWere on a diplomatic mission.\n\nVADER\nIf this is a consular ship... were \nis the Ambassador?\n\nThe Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the \nDark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a \ngruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. \nVader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to \nhis troops.\n\nVADER\nCommander, tear this ship apart until \nyou've found those plans and bring \nme the Ambassador. I want her alive!\n\nThe stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY\n\nThe lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the \nstormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia \nOrgana, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her \neyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds \nof the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the \ntroopers spots her.\n\nTROOPER\nThere she is! Set for stun!\n\nLeia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with \nher laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a \nparalyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.\n\nTROOPER\nShe'll be all right. Inform Lord \nVader we have a prisoner.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY\n\nArtoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. \nHe snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light \nbegins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into \nthe cramped four-man pod.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHey, you're not permitted in there. \nIt's restricted. You'll be deactivated \nfor sure..\n\nArtoo beeps something to him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't call me a mindless philosopher, \nyou overweight glob of grease! Now \ncome out before somebody sees you.\n\nArtoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding \nthe mission he is about to perform.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSecret mission? What plans? What are \nyou talking about? I'm not getting \nin there!\n\nArtoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps \nand twangs angrily.\n\nA new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris \nthrough the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, \nafter a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky \nrobot jumps into the lifepod.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm going to regret this.\n\nINT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER\n\nOn the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified \nrobots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.\n\nCHIEF PILOT\nThere goes another one.\n\nCAPTAIN\nHold your fire. There are no life \nforms. It must have been short-\ncircuited.\n\nINT. LIFEPOD\n\nArtoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  \nStars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat's funny, the damage doesn't \nlook as bad from out here.\n\nArtoo beeps an assuring response.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAre you sure this things safe?\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY\n\nHeat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white \nbuildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty \nempty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to \nget out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist \nat Luke as he flies past.\n\nWOMAN\nI've told you kids to slow down!\n\nINT. POWER STATION - DAY\n\nLuke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged \nmechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been \nasleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the \noffice, yelling wildly.\n\nFIXER\nDid I hear a young noise blast through \nhere?\n\nCAMIE\nIt was just wormie on another rampage.\n\nLuke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak \nand Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are \nplaying a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, \nhandsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy \ncity attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics \nof the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the \nbackground.\n\nLUKE\nShape it up you guys!... Biggs?\n\nLuke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great \njoy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.\n\nLUKE\nI didn't know you were back! When \ndid you get in?\n\nBIGGS\nJust now. I wanted to surprise you, \nhot shot. I thought you'd be here... \ncertainly didn't expect you to be \nout working.\n(he laughs)\n\nLUKE\nThe Academy didn't change you \nmuch...but you're back so soon? Hey, \nwhat happened, didn't you get your \ncommission?\n\nBiggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.\n\nBIGGS\nOf course I got it. Signed aboard \nThe Rand Ecliptic last week. First \nmate Biggs Darklighter at your \nservice...\n(he salutes)\n...I just came to say good-bye to \nall you unfortunate landlocked \nsimpletons.\n\nEveryone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend \nis almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of \nit.\n\nLUKE\nI almost forgot. There's a battle \ngoing on! Right here in our system. \nCome and look!\n\nDEAK\nNot again! Forget it.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - \nDAY\n\nThe group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie \nand The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. \nLuke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.\n\nLUKE\nThere they are!\n\nBiggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to \nsee something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars \nBiggs sees two small silver specks.\n\nBIGGS\nThat's no battle, hot shot... they're \njust sitting there! Probably a \nfreighter-tanker refueling.\n\nLUKE\nBut there was a lot of firing \nearlier...\n\nCamie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the \nbuilding in the process. Luke grabs them.\n\nLUKE\nHey, easy with those...\n\nCAMIE\nDon't worry about it, Wormie.\n\nThe Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs \nhis shoulders in resignation.\n\nFIXER\nI keep telling you, the Rebellion is \na long way from here. I doubt if the \nEmpire would even fight to keep this \nsystem. Believe me Luke, this planet \nis a big hunk of nothing...\n\nLuke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The \ngroup stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about \nLuke's ineptitude.\n\nINT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY\n\nPrincess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad \nof armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is \nbrutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly \nmarching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader \nemerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard \nat the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.\n\nLEIA\nLord Vader, I should have known. \nOnly you could be so bold. The \nImperial Senate will not sit for \nthis, when they hear you've attacked \na diplomatic...\n\nVADER\nDon't play games with me, Your \nHighness. You weren't on any mercy \nmission this time. You passed directly \nthrough a restricted system. Several \ntransmissions were beamed to this \nship by Rebel spies. I want to know \nwhat happened to the plans they sent \nyou.\n\nLEIA\nI don't know what you're talking \nabout. I'm a member of the Imperial \nSenate on a diplomatic mission to \nAlderaan...\n\nVADER\nYou're a part of the Rebel Alliance... \nand a traitor. Take her away!\n\nLeia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering \nhole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander \nturns to Vader.\n\nCOMMANDER\nHolding her is dangerous. If word of \nthis gets out, it could generate \nsympathy for the Rebellion in the \nsenate.\n\nVADER\nI have traced the Rebel spies to \nher. Now she is my only link to find \ntheir secret base!\n\nCOMMANDER\nShe'll die before she tells you \nanything.\n\nVADER\nLeave that to me. Send a distress \nsignal and then inform the senate \nthat all aboard were killed!\n\nAnother Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. \nThey stop and snap to attention.\n\nSECOND OFFICER\nLord Vader, the battle station plans \nare not aboard this ship! And no \ntransmissions were made. An escape \npod was jettisoned during the \nfighting, but no life forms were \naboard.\n\nVader turns to the Commander.\n\nVADER\nShe must have hidden the plans in \nthe escape pod. Send a detachment \ndown to retrieve them. See to it \npersonally, Commander. There'll be \nno one to stop us this time.\n\nCOMMANDER\nYes, sir.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the \nplanet Tatooine.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT\n\nJundland, or \"No Man's Land\", where the rugged desert mesas \nmeet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids \nkick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily \nwork their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in \nthe distance rests half buried in the sand.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHow did I get into this mess? I really \ndon't know how. We seem to be made \nto suffer. It's our lot in life.\n\nArtoo answers with beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI've got to rest before I fall apart. \nMy joints are almost frozen.\n\nArtoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat a desolate place this is.\n\nSuddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts \noff in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio \nstops and yells at him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhere are you going?\n\nA stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small \nrobot.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, I'm not going that way. It's \nmuch too rocky. This way is much \neasier.\n\nArtoo counters with a long whistle.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat makes you think there are \nsettlements over there?\n\nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't get technical with me.\n\nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat mission? What are you talking \nabout? I've had just about enough of \nyou! Go that way! You'll be \nmalfunctioning within a day, you \nnearsighted scrap pile!\n\nThreepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the \ndirection of the vast dune sea.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAnd don't let me catch you following \nme begging for help, because you \nwon't get it.\n\nArtoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges \noff in the direction of the towering mesas.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNo more adventures. I'm not going \nthat way.\n\nArtoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant \nmountains.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA\n\nThreepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a \ndune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless \nmiles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant \nrock mesas.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat malfunctioning little twerp. \nThis is all his fault! He tricked me \ninto going this way, but he'll do no \nbetter.\n\nIn a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand \nfrom his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of \nreflected light in the distance reveals an object moving \ntowards him.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWait, what's that? A transport! I'm \nsaved!\n\nThe bronze android waves frantically and yells at the \napproaching transport.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOver here! Help! Please, help!\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY\n\nLuke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer \nand the others can be heard working inside.\n\nLUKE\n(Very animated)\n...so I cut off my power, shut down \nthe afterburners and came in low on \nDeak's trail. I was so close I thought \nI was going to fry my instruments. \nAs it was I busted up the Skyhopper \npretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty \nupset. He grounded me for the rest \nof the season. You should have been \nthere... it was fantastic.\n\nBIGGS\nYou ought to take it easy Luke. You \nmay be the hottest bushpilot this \nside of Mos Eisley, but those little \nSkyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it \nup, and one day, whammo, you're going \nto be nothing more than a dark spot \non the down side of a canyon wall.\n\nLUKE\nLook who's talking. Now that you've \nbeen around those giant starships \nyou're beginning to sound like my \nuncle. You've gotten soft in the \ncity...\n\nBIGGS\nI've missed you kid.\n\nLUKE\nWell, things haven't been the same \nsince you left, Biggs. It's been \nso... quiet.\n\nBiggs looks around then leans close to Luke.\n\nBIGGS\nLuke, I didn't come back just to say \ngood-bye... I shouldn't tell you \nthis, but you're the only one I can \ntrust... and if I don't come back, I \nwant somebody to know.\n\nLuke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.\n\nLUKE\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nBIGGS\nI made some friends at the Academy.\n(he whispers)\n...when our frigate goes to one of \nthe central systems, we're going to \njump ship and join the Alliance...\n\nLuke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.\n\nLUKE\nJoin the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! \nHow?\n\nBIGGS\nQuiet down will ya! You got a mouth \nbigger than a meteor crater!\n\nLUKE\nI'm sorry. I'm quiet.\n(he whispers)\nListen how quiet I am. You can barely \nhear me...\n\nBiggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.\n\nBIGGS\nMy friend has a friend on Bestine \nwho might help us make contact.\n\nLUKE\nYou're crazy! You could wander around \nforever trying to find them.\n\nBIGGS\nI know it's a long shot, but if I \ndon't find them I'll do what I can \non my own... It's what we always \ntalked about. Luke, I'm not going to \nwait for the Empire to draft me into \nservice. The Rebellion is spreading \nand I want to be on the right side -- \nthe side I believe in.\n\nLUKE\nAnd I'm stuck here...\n\nBIGGS\nI thought you were going to the \nAcademy next term. You'll get your \nchance to get off this rock.\n\nLUKE\nNot likely! I had to cancel my \napplication. There has been a lot of \nunrest among the Sandpeople since \nyou left... they've even raided the \noutskirts of Anchorhead.\n\nBIGGS\nYour uncle could hold off a whole \ncolony of Sandpeople with one blaster.\n\nLUKE\nI know, but he's got enough vaporators \ngoing to make the place pay off. He \nneeds me for just one more season. I \ncan't leave him now.\n\nBIGGS\nI feel for you, Luke, you're going \nto have to learn what seems to be \nimportant or what really is important. \nWhat good is all your uncle's work \nif it's taken over by the Empire?... \nYou know they're starting to \nnationalize commerce in the central \nsystems... it won't be long before \nyour uncle is merely a tenant, slaving \nfor the greater glory of the Empire.\n\nLUKE\nIt couldn't happen here. You said it \nyourself. The Empire won't bother \nwith this rock.\n\nBIGGS\nThings always change.\n\nLUKE\nI wish I was going... Are you going \nto be around long?\n\nBIGGS\nNo, I'm leaving in the morning...\n\nLUKE\nThen I guess I won't see you.\n\nBIGGS\nMaybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.\n\nLUKE\nWell, I'll be at the Academy next \nseason... after that who knows. I \nwon't be drafted into the Imperial \nStarfleet that's for sure...

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET\n\nThe gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange \nforeboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures \nfill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock \ncanyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he \ngoes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \na moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\n\nIn the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \nand a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \nfurther up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \npair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \nnarrow path.\n\nThe unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \nsuddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \nof the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \none short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \nback. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \noff again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \nthan Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \ncautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \ntheir faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \nseen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \nthe heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \nthe trail.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\n\nThe eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\nlike vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a \nsmall disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \nlarge tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \nis sucked into the giant machine.\n\nThe filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \nand enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\n\nINT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA\n\nIt is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo \nswitches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles \naround the scrap heap.

He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper \nand stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \nof the chamber.\n\nINT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA\n\nArtoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the \nmiddle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various \nshapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, \nwhile others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls \nout from the gloom.\n\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo-Detoo! It's you!

Artoo appears to be shut off.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWake up! Wake up!\n\nSuddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, \ncreating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  \nThreepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights \npop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long \nchamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding \nwhite light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the \nodd assortment of robots.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed.\n\nA Jawa starts moving toward them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDo you think they'll melt us down?\n\nArtoo responds, making beeping sounds.\n\nTHREEPIO\nDon't shoot!

TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON\n\nThe Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their \nbattered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of \nthe enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small \nhomestead consisting of three large holes in the ground \nsurrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small \nadobe block house.\n\nThe Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening \nthem up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. \nThe shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting \nsmall insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils \nshould be.\n\nOut of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, \na large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are \nsunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully \ninspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- \nshouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little \nJawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales \npitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\n\nA voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the \nhomestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru \nstanding in the main courtyard.\n\nBERU\nLuke, tell Owen that if he gets a \ntranslator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\n\nLUKE\nIt looks like we don't have much of \na choice but I'll remind him.\n\nLuke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment \nfor sale with the Jawa leader.\n\nOWEN\nI have no need for a protocol droid.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(quickly)\nSir -- not in an environment such as \nthis -- that's why I've also been \nprogrammed for over thirty secondary \nfunctions that...\n\nOWEN\nWhat I really need is a droid that \nunderstands the binary language of \nmoisture vaporators.\n\nTHREEPIO\nVaporators! Sir -- My first job was \nprogramming binary load lifter... \nvery similar to your vaporators. You \ncould say...\n\nOWEN\nDo you speak Bocce?\n\nTHREEPIO\nOf course I can, sir. It's like a \nsecond language for me...

Now come \non, get to it!\n\nLUKE\nAll right, come on! And the red one, \ncome on. Well, come on, Red, let's \ngo.\n\nAs the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back \ninto the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep \nand starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained \nby a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.\n\nOwen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two \nrobots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the \nhead of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.\n\nLUKE\nUncle Owen...\n\nOWEN\nYeah?\n\nLUKE\nThis R2 unit has a bad motivator. \nLook!\n\nOWEN\n(to the head Jawa)\nHey, what're you trying to push on \nus?\n\nThe Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked \nout of line and is moving up and down trying to attract \nattention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps \nLuke on the shoulder.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(pointing to Artoo)\nExcuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is \nin prime condition.

We'll take \nthat one.\n\nWith a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged \nastro-droid for Artoo.\n\nLUKE\nYeah, take it away.\n\nTHREEPIO\nUh, I'm quite sure you'll be very \npleased with that one, sir. He really \nis in first-class condition. I've \nworked with him before. Here he comes.\n\nOwen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots \ntrudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.\n\nLUKE\nOkay, let's go.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nNow, don't you forget this! Why I \nshould stick my neck out for you is \nquite beyond my capacity!\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nThe garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful \natmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers \nhimself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the \nbattered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery \nwith a cord to his face.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThank the maker! This oil bath is \ngoing to feel so good. I've got such \na bad case of dust contamination, I \ncan barely move!\n\nArtoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought \nas he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man \nSkyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. \nFinally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he \nslams a wrench across the workbench.\n\nLUKE\nIt just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is \nright. I'm never gonna get out of \nhere!\n\nTHREEPIO\nIs there anything I might do to help?\n\nLuke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains \nand a tiny smile creeps across his face.\n\nLUKE\nWell, not unless you can alter time, \nspeed up the harvest, or teleport me \noff this rock!\n\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think so, sir. I'm only a \ndroid and not very knowledgeable \nabout such things. Not on this planet, \nanyways. As a matter of fact, I'm \nnot even sure which planet I'm on.\n\nLUKE\nWell, if there's a bright center to \nthe universe, you're on the planet \nthat it's farthest from.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI see, sir.\n\nLUKE\nUh, you can call me Luke.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI see, sir Luke.\n\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nJust Luke.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAnd I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg \nrelations, and this is my counterpart, \nArtoo-Detoo.\n\nLUKE\nHello.\n\nArtoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to \nscrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome \npick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping \noil from his bronze body.\n\nLUKE\nYou got a lot of carbon scoring here. \nIt looks like you boys have seen a \nlot of action.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWith all we've been through, sometimes \nI'm amazed we're in as good condition \nas we are, what with the Rebellion \nand all.\n\nLUKE\nYou know of the Rebellion against \nthe Empire?\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat's how we came to be in your \nservice, if you take my meaning, \nsir.\n\nLUKE\nHave you been in many battles?\n\nTHREEPIO\nSeveral, I think. Actually, there's \nnot much to tell. I'm not much more \nthan an interpreter, and not very \ngood at telling stories. Well, not \nat making them interesting, anyways.\n\nLuke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's \nneck joint. He uses a larger pick.\n\nLUKE\nWell, my little friend, you've got \nsomething jammed in here real good. \nWere you on a cruiser or...\n\nThe fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling \nhead over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\ndimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being \nprojected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a \nrainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly \nlit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.\n\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my \nonly hope.\n\nLUKE\nWhat's this?\n\nArtoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio \nto translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment \nover and over.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat is what?!? He asked you a \nquestion...\n(pointing to Leia)\nWhat is that?\n\nArtoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice \nthe hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer \nfor Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the \nsentence fragment over and over.\n\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my \nonly hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. \nYou're my only hope.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely \na malfunction. Old data. Pay it no \nmind.\n\nLuke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.\n\nLUKE\nWho is she? She's beautiful.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.\n\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\n\nTHREEPIO\nI think she was a passenger on our \nlast voyage. A person of some \nimportance, sir -- I believe. Our \ncaptain was attached to...\n\nLUKE\nIs there more to this recording?\n\nLuke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic \nsqueaks and a whistle.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBehave yourself, Artoo. You're going \nto get us in trouble. It's all right, \nyou can trust him. He's our new \nmaster.\n\nArtoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says he's the property of Obi-Wan \nKenobi, a resident of these parts. \nAnd it's a private message for him. \nQuite frankly, sir I don't know what \nhe's talking about. Our last master \nwas Captain Antilles, but with what \nwe've been through, this little R2 \nunit has become a bit eccentric.\n\nLUKE\nObi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means \nold Ben Kenobi?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI beg your pardon, sir, but do you \nknow what he's talking about?\n\nLUKE\nWell, I don't know anyone named Obi-\nWan, but old Ben lives out beyond \nthe dune sea. He's kind of a strange \nold hermit.\n\nLuke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few \nmoments.\n\nLUKE\nI wonder who she is. It sounds like \nshe's in trouble. I'd better play \nback the whole thing.\n\nArtoo beeps something to Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says the restraining bolt has \nshort circuited his recording system. \nHe suggests that if you remove the \nbolt, he might be able to play back \nthe entire recording.\n\nLuke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't \nreally heard what Threepio has been saying.\n\nLUKE\nH'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're \ntoo small to run away on me if I \ntake this off! Okay.\n\nLuke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off \nArtoo's side.\n\nLUKE\nThere you go.\n\nThe princess immediately disappears...\n\nLUKE\nWell, wait a minute. Where'd she go? \nBring her back! Play back the entire \nmessage.\n\nArtoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in \nembarrassment.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhat message? The one you're carrying \ninside your rusty innards!\n\nA women's voice calls out from another room.\n\nAUNT BERU\nLuke? Luke! Come to dinner!\n\nLuke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning \nrobot.\n\nLUKE\nAll right, I'll be right there, Aunt \nBeru.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm sorry, sir, but he appears to \nhave picked up a slight flutter.\n\nLuke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and \nhurries out of the room.\n\nLUKE\nWell, see what you can do with him. \nI'll be right back.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nJust you reconsider playing that \nmessage for him.\n\nArtoo beeps in response.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNo, I don't think he likes you at \nall.\n\nArtoo beeps.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNo, I don't like you either.\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA\n\nLuke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher \nwith blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-\nused kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls \nof food and starts for the dining area.\n\nLuke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with \nsteaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red \ngrain.\n\nLUKE\nYou know, I think that R2 unit we \nbought might have been stolen.\n\nOWEN\nWhat makes you think that?\n\nLUKE\nWell, I stumbled across a recording \nwhile I was cleaning him. He says he \nbelongs to someone called Obi-Wan \nKenobi.\n\nOwen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but \nmanages to control himself.\n\nLUKE\nI thought he might have meant old \nBen. Do you know what he's talking \nabout? Well, I wonder if he's related \nto Ben.\n\nOwen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.\n\nOWEN\nThat old man's just a crazy old \nwizard. Tomorrow I want you to take \nthat R2 unit into Anchorhead and \nhave its memory flushed. That'll be \nthe end of it. It belongs to us now.\n\nLUKE\nBut what if this Obi-Wan comes looking \nfor him?\n\nOWEN\nHe won't, I don't think he exists \nany more. He died about the same \ntime as your father.\n\nLUKE\nHe knew my father?\n\nOWEN\nI told you to forget it. Your only \nconcern is to prepare the new droids \nfor tomorrow. In the morning I want \nthem on the south ridge working out \nthose condensers.\n\nLUKE\nYes, sir. I think those new droids \nare going to work out fine. In fact, \nI, uh, was also thinking about our \nagreement about my staying on another \nseason. And if these new droids do \nwork out, I want to transmit my \napplication to the Academy this year.\n\nOwen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress \nit.\n\nOWEN\nYou mean the next semester before \nharvest?\n\nLUKE\nSure, there're more than enough \ndroids.\n\nOWEN\nHarvest is when I need you the most. \nOnly one more season. This year we'll \nmake enough on the harvest so I'll \nbe able to hire some more hands. And \nthen you can go to the Academy next \nyear.\n\nLuke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.\n\nOWEN\nYou must understand I need you here, \nLuke.\n\nLUKE\nBut it's a whole 'nother year.\n\nOWEN\nLook, it's only one more season.\n\nLuke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.\n\nLUKE\nYeah, that's what you said last year \nwhen Biggs and Tank left.\n\nAUNT BERU\nWhere are you going?\n\nLUKE\nIt looks like I'm going nowhere. I \nhave to finish cleaning those droids.\n\nResigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen \nmechanically finishes his dinner.\n\nAUNT BERU\nOwen, he can't stay here forever. \nMost of his friends have gone. It \nmeans so much to him.\n\nOWEN\nI'll make it up to him next year. I \npromise.\n\nAUNT BERU\nLuke's just not a farmer, Owen. He \nhas too much of his father in him.\n\nOWEN\nThat's what I'm afraid of.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\n\nThe giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a \ndistant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few \nmoments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the \nhomestead.\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE\n\nLuke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in \nsight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt \nsimilar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the \nbox, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a \nshort yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.\n\nLUKE\nWhat are you doing hiding there?\n\nThreepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in \nsight.\n\nTHREEPIO\nIt wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't \ndeactivate me. I told him not to go, \nbut he's faulty, malfunctioning; \nkept babbling on about his mission.\n\nLUKE\nOh, no!\n\nLuke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD\n\nLuke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead \nand searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-\nrobot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the \nsalt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his \nelectrobinoculars.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat R2 unit has always been a \nproblem. These astro-droids are \ngetting quite out of hand. Even I \ncan't understand their logic at times.\n\nLUKE\nHow could I be so stupid? He's nowhere \nin sight. Blast it!\n\nTHREEPIO\nPardon me, sir, but couldn't we go \nafter him?\n\nLUKE\nIt's too dangerous with all the \nSandpeople around. We'll have to \nwait until morning.\n\nOwen yells up from the homestead plaza.\n\nOWEN\nLuke, I'm shutting the power down \nfor the night.\n\nLUKE\nAll right, I'll be there in a few \nminutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.\n\nHe takes one final look across the dim horizon.\n\nLUKE\nYou know that little droid is going \nto cause me a lot of trouble.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, he excels at that, sir.\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA\n\nMorning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of \nthe open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of \nUncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.\n\nOWEN\nLuke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be \nloafing now!\n\nINT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN\n\nThe interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru \nprepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.\n\nOWEN\nHave you seen Luke this morning?\n\nAUNT BERU\nHe said he had some things to do \nbefore he started today, so he left \nearly.\n\nOWEN\nUh? Did he take those two new droids \nwith him?\n\nAUNT BERU\nI think so.\n\nOWEN\nWell, he'd better have those units \nin the south range repaired be midday \nor there'll be hell to pay!\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY\n\nThe rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio \npilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast \nwasteland.\n\nINT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - \nDAY\n\nLuke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something \nin the motor compartment.\n\nLUKE\n(yelling)\nHow's that.\n\nThreepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the \nwind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.\n\nLUKE\nOld Ben Kenobi lives out in this \ndirection somewhere, but I don't see \nhow that R2 unit could have come \nthis far. We must have missed him. \nUncle Owen isn't going to take this \nvery well.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSir, would it help if you told him \nit was my fault.\n\nLUKE\n(brightening)\nSure. He needs you. He'd probably \nonly deactivate you for a day or \nso...\n\nTHREEPIO\nDeactivate! Well, on the other hand \nif you hadn't removed his restraining \nbolt...\n\nLUKE\nWait, there's something dead ahead \non the scanner. It looks like our \ndroid... hit the accelerator.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY\n\nFrom high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen \ngliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground \ntwo weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert \ncloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the \nmarginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle \nand points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs \nthe gun before it can be fired.\n\nThe Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, \nspeak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an \nanimated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in \nthe final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON\n\nThe Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied \nto a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large \nas elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, \nand long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders \nmount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs \nand ride off down the rugged bluff.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR\n\nThe speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, \nwith his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands \nbefore little Artoo.\n\nLUKE\nHey, whoa, just where do you think \nyou're going?\n\nThe little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses \nmenacingly behind the little runaway.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke here is your rightful \nowner. We'll have no more of this \nObi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't \ntalk to me about your mission, either. \nYou're fortunate he doesn't blast \nyou into a million pieces right here.\n\nLUKE\nWell, come on. It's getting late. I \nonly hope we can get back before \nUncle Owen really blows up.\n\nTHREEPIO\nIf you don't mind my saying so, sir, \nI think you should deactivate the \nlittle fugitive until you've gotten \nhim back to your workshop.\n\nLUKE\nNo, he's not going to try anything.\n\nSuddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic \nwhistles and screams.\n\nLUKE\nWhat's wrong with him now?\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh my... sir, he says there are \nseveral creatures approaching from \nthe southeast.\n\nLuke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.\n\nLUKE\nSandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's \nhave a look. Come on.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY\n\nLuke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and \nscans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the \ntwo riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young \nadventurer.\n\nLUKE\nThere are two Banthas down there but \nI don't see any... wait a second, \nthey're Sandpeople all right. I can \nsee one of them now.\n\nLuke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his \nelectrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of \nhis field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, \ngruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled \nand backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be \nheard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles \ndown the side of the mountain.\n\nThe towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed \ngaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in \nthe heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block \nthe blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. \nThe terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced \nto the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands \nover him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible \nshrieking laugh.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY\n\nArtoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in \nthe rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the \ninert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the \nspeeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts \nand supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then \neverything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan \nis heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the \nSandpeople fleeing in terror.\n\nArtoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight \nswishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even \ncloser, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and \nleans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and \nweathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating \neyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes \nas he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a \nslight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.\n\nBEN\nHello there! Come here my little \nfriend. Don't be afraid.\n\nArtoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and \nbegins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on \nLuke's forehead and he begins to come around.\n\nBEN\nDon't worry, he'll be all right.\n\nLUKE\nWhat happened?\n\nBEN\nRest easy, son, you've had a busy \nday. You're fortunate you're still \nin one piece.\n\nLUKE\nBen? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to \nsee you!\n\nBEN\nThe Jundland wastes are not to be \ntraveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, \nwhat brings you out this far?\n\nLUKE\nOh, this little droid! I think he's \nsearching for his former master... \nI've never seen such devotion in a \ndroid before... there seems to be no \nstopping him. He claims to be the \nproperty of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he \na relative of yours? Do you know who \nhe's talking about?\n\nBen ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.\n\nBEN\nObi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats \na name I haven't heard in a long \ntime... a long time.\n\nLUKE\nI think my uncle knew him. He said \nhe was dead.\n\nBEN\nOh, he's not dead, not... not yet.\n\nLUKE\nYou know him!\n\nBEN\nWell of course, of course I know \nhim. He's me! I haven't gone by the \nname Obi-Wan since oh, before you \nwere born.\n\nLUKE\nThen the droid does belong to you.\n\nBEN\nDon't seem to remember ever owning a \ndroid. Very interesting...\n\nHe suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.\n\nBEN\nI think we better get indoors. The \nSandpeople are easily startled but \nthey will soon be back and in greater \nnumbers.\n\nLuke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic \nbeep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio!\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY\n\nLittle Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins \nto chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and \nBen stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half \nburied in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.\n\nLuke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then \nflips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally \nthe mechanical man's systems turn on.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhere am I? I must have taken a bad \nstep...\n\nLUKE\nCan you stand? We've got to get out \nof here before the Sandpeople return.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think I can make it. You go \non, Master Luke. There's no sense in \nyou risking yourself on my account. \nI'm done for.\n\nArtoo makes a beeping sound.\n\nLUKE\nNo, you're not. What kind of talk is \nthat?\n\nLuke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little \nArtoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around \nsuspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the \nair.\n\nBEN\nQuickly, son... they're on the move.\n\nINT. KENOBI'S DWELLING\n\nThe small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but \nstill manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and \nsecurity. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as \nold Ben sits thinking.\n\nLUKE\nNo, my father didn't fight in the \nwars. He was a navigator on a spice \nfreighter.\n\nBEN\nThat's what your uncle told you. He \ndidn't hold with your father's ideals. \nThought he should have stayed here \nand not gotten involved.\n\nLUKE\nYou fought in the Clone Wars?\n\nBEN\nYes, I was once a Jedi Knight the \nsame as your father.\n\nLUKE\nI wish I'd known him.\n\nBEN\nHe was the best star-pilot in the \ngalaxy, and a cunning warrior. I \nunderstand you've become quite a \ngood pilot yourself. And he was a \ngood friend. Which reminds me...\n\nBen gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  \nAs Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the \nrestraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  \nLuke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the \ntable. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle \nwith several electronic gadgets attached to it.\n\nBEN\nI have something here for you. Your \nfather wanted you to have this when \nyou were old enough, but your uncle \nwouldn't allow it. He feared you \nmight follow old Obi-Wan on some \ndamned-fool idealistic crusade like \nyour father did.\n\nTHREEPIO\nSir, if you'll not be needing me, \nI'll close down for awhile.\n\nLUKE\nSure, go ahead.\n\nBen hands Luke the saber.\n\nLUKE\nWhat is it?\n\nBEN\nYour fathers lightsaber. This is the \nweapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy \nor as random as a blaster.\n\nLuke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out \nabout four feet and flickers there. The light plays across \nthe ceiling.\n\nBEN\nAn elegant weapon for a more civilized \ntime. For over a thousand generations \nthe Jedi Knights were the guardians \nof peace and justice in the Old \nRepublic. Before the dark times, \nbefore the Empire.\n\nLuke hasn't really been listening.\n\nLUKE\nHow did my father die?\n\nBEN\nA young Jedi named Darth Vader, who \nwas a pupil of mine until he turned \nto evil, helped the Empire hunt down \nand destroy the Jedi Knights. He \nbetrayed and murdered your father. \nNow the Jedi are all but extinct. \nVader was seduced by the dark side \nof the Force.\n\nLUKE\nThe Force?\n\nBEN\nWell, the Force is what gives a Jedi \nhis power. It's an energy field \ncreated by all living things. It \nsurrounds us and penetrates us. It \nbinds the galaxy together.\n\nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\n\nBEN\nNow, let's see if we can't figure \nout what you are, my little friend. \nAnd where you come from.\n\nLUKE\nI saw part of the message he was...\n\nLuke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful \nyoung Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.\n\nBEN\nI seem to have found it.\n\nLuke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before \nhis eyes.\n\nLEIA\nGeneral Kenobi, years ago you served \nmy father in the Clone Wars. Now he \nbegs you to help him in his struggle \nagainst the Empire. I regret that I \nam unable to present my father's \nrequest to you in person, but my \nship has fallen under attack and I'm \nafraid my mission to bring you to \nAlderaan has failed. I have placed \ninformation vital to the survival of \nthe Rebellion into the memory systems \nof this R2 unit. My father will know \nhow to retrieve it. You must see \nthis droid safely delivered to him \non Alderaan. This is our most \ndesperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan \nKenobi, you're my only hope.\n\nThere is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  \nOld Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs \non a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.\n\nBEN\nYou must learn the ways of the Force \nif you're to come with me to Alderaan.\n\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nAlderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. \nI've got to go home. It's late, I'm \nin for it as it is.\n\nBEN\nI need your help, Luke. She needs \nyour help. I'm getting too old for \nthis sort of thing.\n\nLUKE\nI can't get involved! I've got work \nto do! It's not that I like the \nEmpire. I hate it! But there's nothing \nI can do about it right now. It's \nsuch a long way from here.\n\nBEN\nThat's your uncle talking.\n\nLUKE\n(sighing)\nOh, God, my uncle. How am I ever \ngoing to explain this?\n\nBEN\nLearn about the Force, Luke.\n\nLUKE\nLook, I can take you as far as \nAnchorhead.

Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, \nis speaking.\n\nTAGGE\nUntil this battle station is fully \noperational we are vulnerable. The \nRebel Alliance is too well equipped. \nThey're more dangerous than you \nrealize.\n\nThe bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.\n\nMOTTI\nDangerous to your starfleet, \nCommander, not to this battle station!\n\nTAGGE\nThe Rebellion will continue to gain \na support in the Imperial Senate as \nlong as....\n\nSuddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut \nshort and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial \noutland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, \nThe Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and \nbow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his \nplace at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind \nhim.\n\nTARKIN\nThe Imperial Senate will no longer \nbe of any concern to us. I've just \nreceived word that the Emperor has \ndissolved the council permanently. \nThe last remnants of the Old Republic \nhave been swept away.\n\nTAGGE\nThat's impossible! How will the \nEmperor maintain control without the \nbureaucracy?\n\nTARKIN\nThe regional governors now have direct \ncontrol over territories. Fear will \nkeep the local systems in line. Fear \nof this battle station.\n\nTAGGE\nAnd what of the Rebellion? If the \nRebels have obtained a complete \ntechnical readout of this station, \nit is possible, however unlikely, \nthat they might find a weakness and \nexploit it.\n\nVADER\nThe plans you refer to will soon be \nback in our hands.\n\nMOTTI\nAny attack made by the Rebels against \nthis station would be a useless \ngesture, no matter what technical \ndata they've obtained. This station \nis now the ultimate power in the \nuniverse. I suggest we use it!\n\nVADER\nDon't be too proud of this \ntechnological terror you've \nconstructed. The ability to destroy \na planet is insignificant next to \nthe power of the Force.\n\nMOTTI\nDon't try to frighten us with your \nsorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your \nsad devotion to that ancient religion \nhas not helped you conjure up the \nstolen data tapes, or given you \nclairvoyance enough to find the \nRebel's hidden fort...\n\nSuddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's \nspell.\n\nVADER\nI find your lack of faith disturbing.\n\nTARKIN\nEnough of this! Vader, release him!\n\nVADER\nAs you wish.\n\nTARKIN\nThis bickering is pointless.

The murky, moldy \nden is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic \nalien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At \nfirst the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, \nfurry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over \ndrinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group \nof repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender \nstops Luke and the robots.\n\nBARTENDER\nWe don't serve their kind here!\n\nLuke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many \noutlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's \ndrift.\n\nLUKE\nWhat?\n\nBARTENDER\nYour droids. They'll have to wait \noutside. We don't want them here.\n\nLuke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the \nGalactic pirates.

We don't want any \ntrouble.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI heartily agree with you sir.\n\nThreepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the \ncreatures at the bar go back to their drinks.\n\nBen is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-\nlooking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with \nfierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\ncovered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  \nOver his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, \nand little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a \nsight to behold.\n\nBen speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times \nduring his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets \nout a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit \ndisconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between \nBen and the giant Wookiee.\n\nLuke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips \nhis drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear \nor whatever.\n\nA large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\n\nCREATURE\nNegola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\n\nThe hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore \nthe creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby \nHuman and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the \nbelligerent monstrosity.\n\nHUMAN\nHe doesn't like you.\n\nLUKE\nI'm sorry.\n\nHUMAN\nI don't like you either.\n\nThe big creature is getting agitated and yells out some \nunintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young \nadventurer.\n\nHUMAN\nDon't insult us. You just watch \nyourself. We're wanted men. I have \nthe death sentence in twelve systems.\n\nLUKE\nI'll be careful than.\n\nHUMAN\nYou'll be dead.\n\nThe rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar \nmoves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His \nthree adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind \nLuke.\n\nBEN\nThis little one isn't worth the \neffort. Come let me buy you \nsomething...\n\nA powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young \nwould-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables \nand breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. \nWith a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked \nchrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. \nThe bartender panics.\n\nBARTENDER\nNo blasters! No blaster!\n\nWith astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life \nand in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut \nin two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, \ncut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns \noff his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. \nLuke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, \nattempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter \nof seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \ngiven a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \nhis bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben \npoints the the Wookiee.\n\nBEN\nThis is Chewbacca. He's first-mate \non a ship that might suit our needs.\n\nEXT.

Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years \nold. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, \nand cocksure.\n\nHAN\nHan Solo. I'm captain of the \nMillennium Falcon. Chewie here tells \nme you're looking for passage to the \nAlderaan system.\n\nBEN\nYes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.\n\nHAN\nFast ship? You've never heard of the \nMillennium Falcon?\n\nBEN\nShould I have?\n\nHAN\nIt's the ship that made the Kessel \nrun in less than twelve parsecs!\n\nBen reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with \nobvious misinformation.\n\nHAN\nI've outrun Imperial starships, not \nthe local bulk-cruisers, mind you. \nI'm talking about the big Corellian \nships now. She's fast enough for \nyou, old man. What's the cargo?\n\nBEN\nOnly passengers. Myself, the boy, \ntwo droids, and no questions asked.\n\nHAN\nWhat is it? Some kind of local \ntrouble?\n\nBEN\nLet's just say we'd like to avoid \nany Imperial entanglements.\n\nHAN\nWell, that's the trick, isn't it? \nAnd it's going to cost you something \nextra. Ten thousand in advance.\n\nLUKE\nTen thousand? We could almost buy \nour own ship for that!\n\nHAN\nBut who's going to fly it, kid! You?\n\nLUKE\nYou bet I could. I'm not such a bad \npilot myself! We don't have to sit \nhere and listen...\n\nBEN\nWe haven't that much with us.

The bartender points to the booth.\n\nTROOPER\nAll right, we'll check it out.\n\nThe stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben \nare gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.\n\nHAN\nSeventeen thousand! Those guys must \nreally be desperate. This could really \nsave my neck. Get back to the ship \nand get her ready.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET\n\nBEN\nYou'll have to sell your speeder.\n\nLUKE\nThat's okay. I'm never coming back \nto this planet again.\n\nINT.

As a matter of fact, I \nwas just going to see your boss. \nTell Jabba that I've got his money.\n\nHan sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the \ngun on him.\n\nGREEDO\nIt's too late. You should have paid \nhim when you had the chance. Jabba's \nput a price on your head, so large \nthat every bounty hunter in the galaxy \nwill be looking for you.

DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM\n\nAdmiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before \nGovernor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen \ndisplaying a small green planet.\n\nMOTTI\nWe've entered the Alderaan system.\n\nVader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her \nhands are bound.\n\nLEIA\nGovernor Tarkin, I should have \nexpected to find you holding Vader's \nleash. I recognized your foul stench \nwhen I was brought on board.\n\nTARKIN\nCharming to the last. You don't know \nhow hard I found it signing the order \nto terminate your life!\n\nLEIA\nI surprised you had the courage to \ntake the responsibility yourself!\n\nTARKIN\nPrincess Leia, before your execution \nI would like you to be my guest at a \nceremony that will make this battle \nstation operational. No star system \nwill dare oppose the Emperor now.\n\nLEIA\nThe more you tighten your grip, \nTarkin, the more star systems will \nslip through your fingers.\n\nTARKIN\nNot after we demonstrate the power \nof this station. In a way, you have \ndetermined the choice of the planet \nthat'll be destroyed first. Since \nyou are reluctant to provide us with \nthe location of the Rebel base, I \nhave chosen to test this station's \ndestructive power... on your home \nplanet of Alderaan.\n\nLEIA\nNo! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no \nweapons. You can't possibly...\n\nTARKIN\nYou would prefer another target? A \nmilitary target? Then name the system!\n\nTarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.\n\nTARKIN\nI grow tired of asking this. So it'll \nbe the last time. Where is the Rebel \nbase?\n\nLeia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to \nAlderaan.\n\nLEIA\n(softly)\nDantooine.\n\nLeia lowers her head.\n\nLEIA\nThey're on Dantooine.\n\nTARKIN\nThere. You see Lord Vader, she can \nbe reasonable.\n(addressing Motti)\nContinue with the operation. You may \nfire when ready.\n\nLEIA\nWhat?\n\nTARKIN\nYou're far too trusting. Dantooine \nis too remote to make an effective \ndemonstration. But don't worry. We \nwill deal with your Rebel friends \nsoon enough.\n\nLEIA\nNo!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER\n\nVADER\nCommence primary ignition.\n\nA button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A \nhooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  \nAnother lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another \nlever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A \nhuge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area \nand converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. \nThe small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA\n\nBen watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small \"seeker\" \nrobot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, \nseems almost faint.\n\nLUKE\nAre you all right? What's wrong?\n\nBEN\nI felt a great disturbance in the \nForce... as if millions of voices \nsuddenly cried out in terror and \nwere suddenly silenced. I fear \nsomething terrible has happened.\n\nBen rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then \nhe fixes his gaze on Luke.\n\nBEN\nYou'd better get on with your \nexercises.\n\nHan Solo enters the room.\n\nHAN\nWell, you can forget your troubles \nwith those Imperial slugs. I told \nyou I'd outrun 'em.\n\nLuke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.\n\nHAN\nDon't everyone thank me at once.\n\nThreepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a \ngame in which three-dimensional holographic figures move \nalong a chess-type board.\n\nHAN\nAnyway, we should be at Alderaan \nabout oh-two-hundred hours.\n\nChewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table \ncovered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the \ntable has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca \nseems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- \ncovered arms over his head.\n\nTHREEPIO\nNow be careful, Artoo.\n\nArtoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his \nstubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures \nto walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's \nface and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. \nThreepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and \nbegins to argue with the huge Wookiee.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe made a fair move. Screaming about \nit won't help you.\n\nHAN\n(interrupting)\nLet him have it. It's not wise to \nupset a Wookiee.\n\nTHREEPIO\nBut sir, nobody worries about \nupsetting a droid.\n\nHAN\nThat's 'cause droids don't pull \npeople's arms out of their socket \nwhen they lose. Wookiees are known \nto do that.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI see your point, sir. I suggest a \nnew strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee \nwin.\n\nLuke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems \nfrozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his \nhead. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  \nHan watches with a bit of smugness.\n\nBEN\nRemember, a Jedi can feel the Force \nflowing through him.\n\nLUKE\nYou mean it controls your actions?\n\nBEN\nPartially. But it also obeys your \ncommands.\n\nSuspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a \n\"seeker\", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, \nhovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of \nthe youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift \nlunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't \nmove and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, \nthen makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood \nred laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing \nhim to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.\n\nHAN\nHokey religions and ancient weapons \nare no match for a good blaster at \nyour side, kid.\n\nLUKE\nYou don't believe in the Force, do \nyou?\n\nHAN\nKid, I've flown from one side of \nthis galaxy to the other. I've seen \na lot of strange stuff, but I've \nnever seen anything to make me believe \nthere's one all-powerful force \ncontrolling everything. There's no \nmystical energy field that controls \nmy destiny.\n\nBen smiles quietly.\n\nHAN\nIt's all a lot of simple tricks and \nnonsense.\n\nBEN\nI suggest you try it again, Luke.\n\nBen places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his \neyes.\n\nBEN\nThis time, let go your conscious \nself and act on instinct.\n\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nWith the blast shield down, I can't \neven see. How am I supposed to fight?\n\nBEN\nYour eyes can deceive you. Don't \ntrust them.\n\nHan skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker \ninto the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then \ndrops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly \nmissing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits \nLuke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful \nyell and attempts to hit the seeker.\n\nBEN\nStretch out with your feelings.\n\nLuke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes \na dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the \nbolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original \nposition.\n\nBEN\nYou see, you can do it.\n\nHAN\nI call it luck.\n\nBEN\nIn my experience, there's no such \nthing as luck.\n\nHAN\nLook, going good against remotes is \none thing. Going good against the \nliving? That's something else.\n\nSolo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the \ncontrol panel.\n\nHAN\nLooks like we're coming up on \nAlderaan.\n\nHan and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.\n\nLUKE\nYou know, I did feel something. I \ncould almost see the remote.\n\nBEN\nThat's good. You have taken your \nfirst step into a larger world.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nImperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the \nevil Dark Lord Darth Vader.\n\nTARKIN\nYes.\n\nOFFICER CASS\nOur scout ships have reached \nDantooine. They found the remains of \na Rebel base, but they estimate that \nit has been deserted for some time. \nThey are now conducting an extensive \nsearch of the surrounding systems.\n\nTARKIN\nShe lied! She lied to us!\n\nVADER\nI told you she would never consciously \nbetray the Rebellion.\n\nTARKIN\nTerminate her... immediately!\n\nEXT. HYPERSPACE\n\nThe pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange \nsurreal light show surrounds the ship.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nHAN\nStand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in \nthe sublight engines.\n\nHan pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window \nstars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then \nstop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently \nshake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering \nthe sides of the ship.\n\nHAN\nWhat the...? Aw, we've come out of \nhyperspace into a meteor shower. \nSome kind of asteroid collision. \nIt's not on any of the charts.\n\nThe Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool \nin the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing \ncockpit.\n\nLUKE\nWhat's going on?\n\nHAN\nOur position is correct, except... \nno, Alderaan!\n\nLUKE\nWhat do you mean? Where is it?\n\nHAN\nThats what I'm trying to tell you, \nkid. It ain't there. It's been totally \nblown away.\n\nLUKE\nWhat? How?\n\nBen moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to \nsettle down.\n\nBEN\nDestroyed... by the Empire!\n\nHAN\nThe entire starfleet couldn't destroy \nthe whole planet. It'd take a thousand \nships with more fire power than \nI've...\n\nA signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled \nalarm starts humming.\n\nHAN\nThere's another ship coming in.\n\nLUKE\nMaybe they know what happened.\n\nBEN\nIt's an Imperial fighter.\n\nChewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside \nthe cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned \nImperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.\n\nLUKE\nIt followed us!\n\nBEN\nNo. It's a short range fighter.\n\nHAN\nThere aren't any bases around here. \nWhere did it come from?\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nLUKE\nIt sure is leaving in a big hurry. \nIf they identify us, we're in big \ntrouble.\n\nHAN\nNot if I can help it. Chewie...jam \nit's transmissions.\n\nBEN\nIt'd be as well to let it go. It's \ntoo far out of range.\n\nHAN\nNot for long...\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the \nvastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nThe tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny \nfighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter \nuntil it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben \nstands behind Chewbacca.\n\nBEN\nA fighter that size couldn't get \nthis deep into space on its own.\n\nLUKE\nIt must have gotten lost, been part \nof a convoy or something.\n\nHAN\nWell, he ain't going to be around \nlong enough to tell anyone about us.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as \nthey race toward camera and disappear over head.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nThe distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or \nplanet.\n\nLUKE\nLook at him. He's headed for that \nsmall moon.\n\nHAN\nI think I can get him before he gets \nthere... he's almost in range.\n\nThe small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous \nspherical battle station.\n\nBEN\nThat's no moon! It's a space station.\n\nHAN\nIt's too big to be a space station.\n\nLUKE\nI have a very bad feeling about this.\n\nHAN\nYeah, I think your right. Full \nreverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary \npower.\n\nThe pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away \ntoward the gargantuan battle station.\n\nLUKE\nWhy are we still moving towards it?\n\nHAN\nWe're caught in a tractor beam! It's \npulling us in!\n\nLUKE\nBut there's gotta be something you \ncan do!\n\nHAN\nThere's nothin' I can do about it, \nkid. I'm in full power. I'm going to \nhave to shut down. But they're not \ngoing to get me without a fight!\n\nBen Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.\n\nBEN\nYou can't win. But there are \nalternatives to fighting.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR\n\nAs the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome \nmetal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station \nbecomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic \nsphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which \nthe helpless pirateship is dragged.\n\nEXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS\n\nThe helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port \ncontrol room and huge laser turret cannons.\n\nVOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM\n\nClear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic \nfield.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037\n\nThe pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death \nStar, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers \nstand at attention in a central assembly area.\n\nOFFICER\nTo you stations!\n(to another officer)\nCome with me.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY\n\nStormtroopers run to their posts.\n\nINT.

DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nTarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.\n\nTARKIN\nYes.\n\nVOICE\n(over intercom)\nWe've captured a freighter entering \nthe remains of the Alderaan system. \nIt's markings match those of a ship \nthat blasted its way out of Mos \nEisley.\n\nVADER\nThey must be trying to return the \nstolen plans to the princess. She \nmay yet be of some use to us.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037\n\nVader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and \nseveral heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.\n\nVOICE\n(over intercom)\nUnlock one-five-seven and nine. \nRelease charges.\n\nOFFICER\n(to Vader)\nThere's no one on board, sir. \nAccording to the log, the crew \nabandoned ship right after takeoff. \nIt must be a decoy, sir. Several of \nthe escape pods have been jettisoned.\n\nVADER\nDid you find any droids?\n\nOFFICER\nNo, sir. If there were any on board, \nthey must also have jettisoned.\n\nVADER\nSend a scanning crew on board. I \nwant every part of this ship checked.\n\nOFFICER\nYes, sir.\n\nVADER\nI sense something... a presence I \nhaven't felt since...\n\nVader turns quickly and exits the hangar.\n\nOFFICER\nGet me a scanning crew in here on \nthe double. I want every part of \nthis ship checked!\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY\n\nA trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In \na few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant \nofficer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly \npop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his \nhead out of a third locker.\n\nLUKE\nBoy, it's lucky you had these \ncompartments.\n\nHAN\nI use them for smuggling. I never \nthought I'd be smuggling myself in \nthem. This is ridiculous. Even if I \ncould take off, I'd never get past \nthe tractor beam.\n\nBEN\nLeave that to me!\n\nHAN\nDamn fool. I knew that you were going \nto say that!\n\nBEN\nWho's the more foolish... the fool \nor the fool who follows him?\n\nHan shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nThe crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the \ntwo stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.\n\nTROOPER\nThe ship's all yours. If the scanners \npick up anything, report it \nimmediately. All right, let's go.\n\nThe crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound \nis followed by a voice calling to the guard below.\n\nHAN'S VOICE\nHey down there, could you give us a \nhand with this?\n\nThe stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire \nis heard.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE\n\nIn a very small command office near the entrance to the \npirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices \nthe guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.\n\nGANTRY OFFICER\nTX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at \nyour post? TX-four-one-two, do you \ncopy?\n\nA stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and \nwaves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating \nhis comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his \nhead in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an \nannoyed look.\n\nGANTRY OFFICER\nTake over. We've got a bad \ntransmitter. I'll see what I can do.\n\nAs the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing \nthe towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary \nstate of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling \nhowl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. \nThe aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted \nby Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the \nrobots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed \nas a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.\n\nLUKE\nYou know, between his howling and \nyour blasting everything in sight, \nit's a wonder the whole station \ndoesn't know we're here.\n\nHAN\nBring them on! I prefer a straight \nfight to all this sneaking around.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe found the computer outlet, sir.\n\nBen feeds some information into the computer and a map of \nthe city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it \ncarefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  \nArtoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.\n\nBEN\nPlug in. He should be able to \ninterpret the entire Imperial computer \nnetwork.\n\nArtoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the \nvast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information \nto the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHe says he's found the main computer \nto power the tractor beam that's \nholding the ship here. He'll try to \nmake the precise location appear on \nthe monitor.\n\nThe computer monitor flashes readouts.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThe tractor beam is coupled to the \nmain reactor in seven locations. A \npower loss at one of the terminals \nwill allow the ship to leave.\n\nBen studies the data on the monitor readout.\n\nBEN\nI don't think you boys can help. I \nmust go alone.\n\nHAN\nWhatever you say. I've done more \nthat I bargained for on this trip \nalready.\n\nLUKE\nI want to go with you.\n\nBEN\nBe patient, Luke. Stay and watch \nover the droids.\n\nLUKE\nBut he can...\n\nBEN\nThey must be delivered safely or \nother star systems will suffer the \nsame fate as Alderaan. Your destiny \nlies along a different path than \nmine. The Force will be with you... \nalways!\n\nBen adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps \nout of the command office, then disappears down a long grey \nhallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head \nin agreement.\n\nHAN\nBoy you said it, Chewie.\n\nHan looks at Luke.\n\nHAN\nWhere did you dig up that old fossil?\n\nLUKE\nBen is a great man.\n\nHAN\nYeah, great at getting us into \ntrouble.\n\nLUKE\nI didn't hear you give any ideas...\n\nHAN\nWell, anything would be better than \njust hanging around waiting for him \nto pick us up...\n\nLUKE\nWho do you think...\n\nSuddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  \nLuke goes over to him.\n\nLUKE\nWhat is it?\n\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. \nHe says \"I found her\", and keeps \nrepeating, \"She's here.\"\n\nLUKE\nWell, who... who has he found?\n\nArtoo whistles a frantic reply.\n\nTHREEPIO\nPrincess Leia.\n\nLUKE\nThe princess? She's here?\n\nHAN\nPrincess? What's going on?\n\nTHREEPIO\nLevel five. Detention block A A-twenty-\nthree. I'm afraid she's scheduled to \nbe terminated.\n\nLUKE\nOh, no! We've got to do something.\n\nHAN\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nLUKE\nThe droid belongs to her. She's the \none in the message... We've got to \nhelp her.\n\nHAN\nNow, look, don't get any funny ideas. \nThe old man wants us to wait right \nhere.\n\nLUKE\nBut he didn't know she was here. \nLook, will you just find a way back \ninto the detention block?\n\nHAN\nI'm not going anywhere.\n\nLUKE\nThey're going to execute her. Look, \na few minutes ago you said you didn't \nwant to just wait here to be captured. \nNow all you want to do is stay.\n\nHAN\nMarching into the detention area is \nnot what I had in mind.\n\nLUKE\nBut they're going to kill her!\n\nHAN\nBetter her than me...\n\nLUKE\nShe's rich.\n\nChewbacca growls.\n\nHAN\nRich?\n\nLUKE\nYes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you \nwere to rescue her, the reward would \nbe...\n\nHAN\nWhat?\n\nLUKE\nWell more wealth that you can imagine.\n\nHAN\nI don't know, I can imagine quite a \nbit!\n\nLUKE\nYou'll get it!\n\nHAN\nI better!\n\nLUKE\nYou will...\n\nHAN\nAll right, kid. But you'd better be \nright about this.\n\nHan looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.\n\nLUKE\nAll right.\n\nHAN\nWhat's your plan?\n\nLUKE\nUh... Threepio, hand me those binders \nthere will you?\n\nLuke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.\n\nLUKE\nOkay. Now, I'm going to put these on \nyou.\n\nChewie lets out a hideous growl.\n\nLUKE\nOkay. Han, you put these on.\n\nLuke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.\n\nHAN\nDon't worry, Chewie. I think I know \nwhat he has in mind.\n\nThe Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as \nHan binds him with the electronic cuffs.\n\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke, sir! Pardon me for \nasking... but, ah... what should \nArtoo and I do if we're discovered \nhere?\n\nLUKE\nLock the door!\n\nHAN\nAnd hope they don't have blasters.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThat isn't very reassuring.\n\nLuke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and \nstart off into the giant Imperial Death Star.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE\n\nHan and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits \nas they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, \nbureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio \ncompletely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious \nglance.\n\nFinally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.\n\nLUKE\nI can't see a thing in this helmet.\n\nA bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away \nby Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and \nthe elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY\n\nSeveral Imperial officers walk through the wide main \npassageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot \nsimilar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end \nof the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then \ndisappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting \nthat it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. \nNo one in the hallway seems to notice him.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY \nAREA\n\nLuke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door \nslides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards \nenter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates \nare everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.\n\nHAN\nThis is not going to work.\n\nLUKE\nWhy didn't you say so before?\n\nHAN\nI did say so before!\n\nINT. DETENTION AREA\n\nElevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches \nthe trio.\n\nOFFICER\nWhere are you taking this... thing?\n\nChewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut \nup.\n\nLUKE\nPrisoner transfer from Block one-one-\nthree-eight.\n\nOFFICER\nI wasn't notified. I'll have to clear \nit.\n\nThe officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in \nthe information. There are only three other troopers in the \narea. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the \nalarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of \nChewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\n\nSuddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one \nof his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.\n\nHAN\nLook out! He's loose!\n\nLUKE\nHe's going to pull us all apart.\n\nHAN\nGo get him!\n\nThe startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and \nHan have already pulled out their laser pistols and are \nblasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of \nlaserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \ngate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \nlast of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \nabout to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink \nsystem, which is screeching questions about what is going \non.  He quickly checks the computer readout.\n\nHAN\nWe've got to find out which cell \nthis princess of yours is in. Here \nit is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. \nYou go get her. I'll hold them here.\n\nLuke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into \nthe buzzing comlink.\n\nHAN\n(sounding official)\nEverything is under control. Situation \nnormal.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWhat happened?\n\nHAN\n(getting nervous)\nUh... had a slight weapons \nmalfunction. But, uh, everything's \nperfectly all right now. We're fine. \nWe're all fine here, now, thank you. \nHow are you?\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWe're sending a squad up.\n\nHAN\nUh, uh, negative. We had a reactor \nleak here now. Give us a few minutes \nto lock it down. Large leak... very \ndangerous.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWho is this? What's your operating \nnumber?\n\nHan blasts the comlink and it explodes.\n\nHAN\nBoring conversation anyway.\n(yelling down the \nhall)\nLuke! We're going to have company!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW\n\nLuke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door \naway with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees \nthe dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping \nand is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on \nher face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands \nstaring at her with his mouth hanging open.\n\nLEIA\n(finally)\nAren't you a little short to be a \nstormtrooper?\n\nLuke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.\n\nLUKE\nWhat? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke \nSkywalker. I'm here to rescue you.\n\nLEIA\nYou're who?\n\nLUKE\nI'm here to rescue you. I've got \nyour R2 unit. I'm here with Ben \nKenobi.\n\nLEIA\nBen Kenobi is here! Where is he?\n\nLUKE\nCome on!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nDarth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the \nfar end of the conference table.\n\nVADER\nHe is here...\n\nTARKIN\nObi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think \nso?\n\nVADER\nA tremor in the Force. The last time \nI felt it was in the presence of my \nold master.\n\nTARKIN\nSurely he must be dead by now.\n\nVADER\nDon't underestimate the power of the \nForce.\n\nTARKIN\nThe Jedi are extinct, their fire has \ngone out of the universe. You, my \nfriend, are all that's left of their \nreligion.\n\nThere is a quiet buzz on the comlink.\n\nTARKIN\nYes.\n\nINTERCOM VOICE\nGovernor Tarkin, we have an emergency \nalert in detention block A A-twenty-\nthree.\n\nTARKIN\nThe princess! Put all sections on \nalert!\n\nVADER\nObi-Wan is here. The Force is with \nhim.\n\nTARKIN\nIf you're right, he must not be \nallowed to escape.\n\nVADER\nEscape is not his plan. I must face \nhim alone.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY\n\nAn ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the \nelevator door.\n\nHAN\nChewie!\n\nChewbacca responds with a growling noise.\n\nHAN\nGet behind me! Get behind me!\n\nA series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door \nthrough which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.\n\nHan and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke \nand flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting \nup with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.\n\nHAN\nCan't get out that way.\n\nLEIA\nLooks like you managed to cut off \nour only escape route.\n\nHAN\n(sarcastically)\nMaybe you'd like it back in your \ncell, Your Highness.\n\nLuke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they \ncontinue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their \nway down the corridor.\n\nLUKE\nSee-Threepio! See-Threepio!\n\nTHREEPIO\n(over comlink)\nYes sir?\n\nLUKE\nWe've been cut off! Are there any \nother ways out of the cell bay?... \nWhat was that? I didn't copy!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER\n\nThreepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and \nwhistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink \ntransmitter.\n\nTHREEPIO\nI said, all systems have been alerted \nto your presence, sir. The main \nentrance seems to be the only way in \nor out; all other information on \nyour level is restricted.\n\nSomeone begins banging on the door.\n\nTROOPER VOICE\nOpen up in there!\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR\n\nLuke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as \nthey continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca \nare barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far \nand of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke \nfills the narrow cell corridor.\n\nLUKE\nThere isn't any other way out.\n\nHAN\nI can't hold them off forever! Now \nwhat?\n\nLEIA\nThis is some rescue. When you came \nin here, didn't you have a plan for \ngetting out?\n\nHAN\n(pointing to Luke)\nHe's the brains, sweetheart.\n\nLuke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.\n\nLUKE\nWell, I didn't...\n\nThe princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in \nthe wall next to Han, almost frying him.\n\nHAN\nWhat the hell are you doing?\n\nLEIA\nSomebody has to save our skins. Into \nthe garbage chute, wise guy.\n\nShe jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca \nlook on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and \nsays something.\n\nHAN\nGet in there you big furry oaf! I \ndon't care what you smell! Get in \nthere and don't worry about it.\n\nHan gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the \ntiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their \nway toward the opening.\n\nHAN\nWonderful girl! Either I'm going to \nkill her or I'm beginning to like \nher. Get in there!\n\nLuke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires \noff a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then \nslides into the chute himself and is gone.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nHan tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  \nLuke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He \nfinds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't \nbudge.\n\nHAN\n(sarcastically)\nOh! The garbage chute was a really \nwonderful idea. What an incredible \nsmell you've discovered! Let's get \nout of here! Get away from there...\n\nLUKE\nNo! wait!\n\nHan draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The \nlaserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  \nEveryone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes \nalmost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a \nrather grim look on her face.\n\nLUKE\nWill you forget it? I already tried \nit. It's magnetically sealed!\n\nLEIA\nPut that thing away! You're going to \nget us all killed.\n\nHAN\nAbsolutely, Your Worship. Look, I \nhad everything under control until \nyou led us down here. You know, it's \nnot going to take them long to figure \nout what happened to us.\n\nLEIA\nIt could be worse...\n\nA loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the \nmurky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins \nto back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols \ndrawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.\n\nHAN\nIt's worse.\n\nLUKE\nThere's something alive in here!\n\nHAN\nThat's your imagination.\n\nLUKE\nSomething just moves past my leg! \nLook! Did you see that?\n\nHAN\nWhat?\n\nLUKE\nHelp!\n\nSuddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.\n\nHAN\nLuke! Luke! Luke!\n\nSolo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air \nand thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around \nhis throat.\n\nLEIA\nLuke!\n\nLeia extends a long pipe toward him.\n\nLEIA\nLuke, Luke, grab a hold of this.\n\nLUKE\nBlast it, will you! My gun's jammed.\n\nHAN\nWhere?\n\nLUKE\nAnywhere! Oh!!\n\nSolo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the \nmuck by the slimy tentacle.\n\nHAN\nLuke! Luke!\n\nSuddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and \nmove in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  \nHan and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca \nhowls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke \nsuddenly bobs to the surface.\n\nLEIA\nGrab him!\n\nLuke seems to be released by the thing.\n\nLEIA\nWhat happened?\n\nLUKE\nI don't know, it just let go of me \nand disappeared...\n\nHAN\nI've got a very bad feeling about \nthis.\n\nBefore anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and \nedge toward the Rebels.\n\nLUKE\nThe walls are moving!\n\nLEIA\nDon't just stand there. Try to brace \nit with something.\n\nThey place poles and long metal beams between the closing \nwalls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant \ntrashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.\n\nLUKE\nWait a minute!\n\nLuke pulls out his comlink.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! \nWhere could he be?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE\n\nA soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for \nSee-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which \nis sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and \nThreepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great \nexplosion and the door of the control tower flies across the \nfloor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nTake over!\n(pointing to the dead \nofficer)\nSee to him! Look there!\n\nA trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides \nopen. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows \nhis bronze companion out into the office.\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey're madmen! They're heading for \nthe prison level. If you hurry, you \nmight catch them.\n\nFIRST OFFICER\n(to his troops)\nFollow me! You stand guard.\n\nThe troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to \nwatch over the command office.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nCome on!\n\nThe guard aims a blaster at them.\n\nTHREEPIO\nOh! All this excitement has overrun \nthe circuits of my counterpart here. \nIf you don't mind, I'd like to take \nhim down to maintenance.\n\nTROOPER\nAll right.\n\nThe guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries \nout the door.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nAs the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  \nChewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his \ngiant paws.\n\nHan is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is \nsnapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.\n\nLUKE\nThreepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!\n\nHan and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. \nLeia begins to sink into the trash.\n\nHAN\nGet to the top!\n\nLEIA\nI can't\n\nLUKE\nWhere could he be? Threepio! Threepio, \nwill you come in?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey aren't here! Something must \nhave happened to them. See if they've \nbeen captured.\n\nLittle Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall \nsocket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from \nthe tiny robot.\n\nTHREEPIO\nHurry!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nThe walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against \nthe walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each \nother. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds \nit tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels \nthe first crushing pressure against her body.\n\nHAN\nOne thing's for sure. We're all going \nto be a lot thinner!\n(to Leia)\nGet on top of it!\n\nLEIA\nI'm trying!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nThank goodness, they haven't found \nthem! Where could they be?\n\nArtoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.\n\nTHREEPIO\nUse the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I \nturned it off!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nMeanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his \nhead above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz \nand he rips it off his belt.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nMuffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, \nbut not distinctly.\n\nTHREEPIO\nAre you there, sir?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nLUKE\nThreepio!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe've had some problems...\n\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nWill you shut up and listen to me? \nShut down all garbage mashers on the \ndetention level, will you? Do you \ncopy?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nLUKE\nShut down all the garbage mashers on \nthe detention level.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nShut down all the garbage mashers on \nthe detention level.\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nNo. Shut them all down! Hurry!\n\nThreepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible \nscreaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.\n\nTHREEPIO\nListen to them! They're dying, Artoo! \nCurse my metal body! I wasn't fast \nenough. It's all my fault! My poor \nmaster!\n\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nThreepio, we're all right!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\n\nThe screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. \nThe walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace \nin the background.\n\nLUKE\nWe're all right. You did great.\n\nLuke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a \nnumber.\n\nLUKE\nHey... hey, open the pressure \nmaintenance hatch on unit number... \nwhere are we?\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL\n\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nThree-two-six-eight-two-seven.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH\n\nBen enters a humming service trench that powers the huge \ntractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. \nThe clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. \nThe old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading \nto a control panel that connects two large cables. He \ncarefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, \nand several lights on the board go from red to blue.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY\n\nThe group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  \nHan and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster \nbelts.\n\nHAN\nIf we can just avoid any more female \nadvice, we ought to be able to get \nout of here.\n\nLuke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster \nfrom Solo.\n\nLUKE\nWell, let's get moving!\n\nChewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage \nroom, as he runs away and then stops howling.\n\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nWhere are you going?\n\nThe Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy \ntentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a \nvictim. Han aims his pistol.\n\nLEIA\nNo, wait. They'll hear!\n\nHan fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes \nrelentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply \nshakes his head in disgust.\n\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nCome here, you big coward!\n\nChewie shakes his head \"no.\"\n\nHAN\nChewie! Come here!\n\nLEIA\nListen. I don't know who you are, or \nwhere you came from, but from now \non, you do as I tell you. Okay?\n\nHan is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.\n\nHAN\nLook, Your Worshipfulness, let's get \none thing straight! I take orders \nfrom one person! Me!\n\nLEIA\nIt's a wonder you're still alive.\n(looking at Chewie)\nWill somebody get this big walking \ncarpet out of my way?\n\nHan watches her start away. He looks at Luke.\n\nHAN\nNo reward is worth this.\n\nThey follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH\n\nSuddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of \nstormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly \nslips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few \nfeet of him.\n\nOFFICER\nSecure this area until the alert is \ncanceled.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nGive me regular reports.\n\nAll but two of the stormtroopers leave.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nDo you know what's going on?\n\nSECOND TROOPER\nMaybe it's another drill.\n\nBen moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers \nas they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand \ntoward them, as the troops think they hear something in the \nother hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips \npast the troopers and into the main hallway.\n\nSECOND TROOPER\nWhat was that?\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nOh, it's nothing. Don't worry about \nit.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY\n\nLuke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and \nstop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers \nare milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.\n\nHAN\n(looking at his ship)\nThere she is.\n\nLUKE\nSee-Threepio, do you copy?\n\nTHREEPIO\n(voice)\nFor the moment. Uh, we're in the \nmain hangar across from the ship.\n\nLUKE\nWe're right above you. Stand by.\n\nHan is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of \nthe pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and \npoints out the window to the ship.\n\nLEIA\nYou came in that thing? You're braver \nthat I thought.\n\nHAN\nNice! Come on!\n\nHan gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the \nhallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty \nImperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are \ntaken by surprise and stop in their tracks.\n\nFIRST TROOPER\nIt's them! Blast them!\n\nBefore even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges \nthe troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the \nstormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down \nthe corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.\n\nHAN\n(to Luke and Leia)\nGet back to the ship!\n\nLUKE\nWhere are you going? Come back!\n\nHan has already rounded a corner and does not hear.\n\nLEIA\nHe certainly has courage.\n\nLUKE\nWhat good will it do us if he gets \nhimself killed? Come on!\n\nLuke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for \nmuted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke \nand Leia start off toward the starship hangar.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\nHan chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is \nyelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a \ndead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few \nfeet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops \nbegin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are \nmoving into an attack position in front of the lone \nstarpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops \nbegin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\nChewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt \nto save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of \nlaser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate \nextraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of \nfurious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running \nthe other way also.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\nLuke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down \na narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They \nquickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an \nopen hatchway.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT\n\nLuke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge \nthat spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. \nThe bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, \nand Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance \noff the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of \nhis arm and pulls him back.\n\nLUKE\n(gasping)\nI think we took a wrong turn.\n\nBlasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby \nreminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at \nthe advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch \nthat pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving \nthem precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  \nLaserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.\n\nLEIA\nThere's no lock!\n\nLuke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.\n\nLUKE\nThat oughta hold it for a while.\n\nLEIA\nQuick, we've got to get across. Find \nthe control that extends the bridge.\n\nLUKE\nOh, I think I just blasted it.\n\nLuke looks at the blasted bridge control while the \nstormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making \nominous drilling and pounding sounds.\n\nLEIA\nThey're coming through!\n\nLuke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when \nlaserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol \nat a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across \nthe abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops \nappear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, \nand grabs at his chest.\n\nAnother trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by \nLuke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move \nback off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.\n\nLUKE\nHere, hold this.\n\nLuke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. \nIt has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge \noverhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the \nrope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears \nand fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  \nSuddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet \nof more troops.\n\nLEIA\nHere they come!\n\nLeia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and \nhe falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the \ngorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He \ntugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the \nprincess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him \nquickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.\n\nLEIA\nFor luck!\n\nLuke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss \nto the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as \nLuke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the \nstormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at \nthe escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into \nthe tiny subhallway.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY\n\nBen hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several \nstormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks \nto make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the \nopposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of \nthe hallway and starts after the old Jedi.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nThreepio looks around at the troops milling about the \npirateship entry ramp.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWhere could they be?\n\nArtoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left \nand right, beeping a response.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR\n\nHan and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several \ntroopers hot on their trail.\n\nTROOPER\nClose the blast doors!\n\nAt the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in \nfront of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion \nrace past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage \nto get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops \nbefore the doors slam shut.\n\nTROOPER\nOpen the blast doors! Open the blast \ndoors!\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nBen hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar \nwhere the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, \nDarth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not \nten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his \nand steps slowly forward.\n\nVADER\nI've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. \nWe meet again, at last. The circle \nis now complete.\n\nBen Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive \nposition. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.\n\nVADER\nWhen I left you, I was but the \nlearner; now I am the master.\n\nBEN\nOnly a master of evil, Darth.\n\nThe two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few \nmoments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right \nmoment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, \nas if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He \nshakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.\n\nBen makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked \nby a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke \nby Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's \nblows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark \nLord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. \nThe two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments \nwith laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing \nsound.\n\nVADER\nYour powers are weak, old man.\n\nBEN\nYou can't win, Darth. If you strike \nme down, I shall become more powerful \nthan you can possibly imagine.\n\nTheir lightsabers continue to meet in combat.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\nHan Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back \nagainst the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the \nImperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.\n\nHAN\nDidn't we just leave this party?\n\nChewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.\n\nHAN\nWhat kept you?\n\nLEIA\nWe ran into some old friends.\n\nLUKE\nIs the ship all right?\n\nHAN\nSeems okay, if we can get to it. \nJust hope the old man got the tractor \nbeam out of commission.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY\n\nVader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they \nhit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. \nTroopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord \nof The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his \ngroup's vantage point.\n\nLUKE\nLook!\n\nLuke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader \nemerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking \nbay.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY\n\nThreepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's \nImperial docking bay.\n\nTHREEPIO\nCome on, Artoo, we're going!\n\nThreepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who \nwere guarding the starship rush past them heading towards \nBen and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.\n\nINT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY\n\nSolo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The \ntroops rush toward the battling knights.\n\nHAN\nNow's our chance! Go!\n\nThey start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops \ncharging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader \ntakes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings \nhis mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to \ndeflect the blow and swiftly turns around.\n\nThe old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts \nhis sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene \nlook on his face.\n\nVader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's \ncloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  \nVader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the \nempty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers \nand the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two \nand starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.\n\nLUKE\nNo!\n\nThe stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  \nThe robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium \nFalcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns \ntheir fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and \nadvances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.\n\nHAN\n(to Luke)\nCome on!\n\nLEIA\nCome on! Luke, its too late!\n\nHAN\nBlast the door! Kid!\n\nLuke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it \nexplodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge \nforward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close \nbehind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the \ndocking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his \nonrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, \nas Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He \nfires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.\n\nBEN'S VOICE\nRun, Luke! Run!\n\nLuke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns \ntoward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the \ntroopers and races into the ship.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT\n\nHan pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. \nThe dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the \nship as Chewie adjusts his controls.\n\nHAN\nI hope the old man got that tractor \nbeam out if commission, or this is \ngoing to be a real short trip. Okay, \nhit it!\n\nChewbacca growls in agreement.\n\nEXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON\n\nThe Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking \nbay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness \nof space.\n\nINT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA\n\nLuke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off \nblankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around \nhim protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She \nsits down beside him.\n\nINT.

It's not over yet!\n\nHAN\nIt is for me, sister! Look, I ain't \nin this for your revolution, and I'm \nnot in it for you, Princess. I expect \nto be well paid.

I \nwonder if he really cares about \nanything... or anyone.\n\nLUKE\nI care!\n\nLuke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han \nstare out at the vast blackness of space.\n\nLUKE\nSo... what do you think of her, Han?\n\nHAN\nI'm trying not to, kid!\n\nLUKE\n(under his breath)\nGood...\n\nHAN\nStill, she's got a lot of spirit.

The battle station has \nsurely tracked us here.\n(looking pointedly to \nHan)\nIt's the only explanation for the \nease of our escape.

Leia \nand several other senators are to one side of the giant \nreadout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, \nnavigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is \nlistening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and \nChewbacca are standing near the back.\n\nDODONNA\nThe battle station is heavily shielded \nand carries a firepower greater than \nhalf the star fleet. It's defenses \nare designed around a direct large-\nscale assault. A small one-man fighter \nshould be able to penetrate the outer \ndefense.\n\nGold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands \nand addresses Dodonna.\n\nGOLD LEADER\nPardon me for asking, sir, but what \ngood are snub fighters going to be \nagainst that?\n\nDODONNA\nWell, the Empire doesn't consider a \nsmall one-man fighter to be any \nthreat, or they'd have a tighter \ndefense. An analysis of the plans \nprovided by Princess Leia has \ndemonstrated a weakness in the battle \nstation.\n\nArtoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping \nsounds, and turns his head from right to left.\n\nDODONNA\nThe approach will not be easy. You \nare required to maneuver straight \ndown this trench and skim the surface \nto this point. The target area is \nonly two meters wide. It's a small \nthermal exhaust port, right below \nthe main port. The shaft leads \ndirectly to the reactor system. A \nprecise hit will start a chain \nreaction which should destroy the \nstation.\n\nA murmer of disbelief runs through the room.\n\nDODONNA\nOnly a precise hit will set up a \nchain reaction. The shaft is ray-\nshielded, so you'll have to use proton \ntorpedoes.\n\nLuke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about \nsixteen years old.\n\nWEDGE\nThat's impossible, even for a \ncomputer.\n\nLUKE\nIt's not impossible. I used to bull's-\neye womp rats in my T-sixteen back \nhome. They're not much bigger than \ntwo meters.\n\nDODONNA\nMan your ships! And may the Force be \nwith you!\n\nThe group rises and begins to leave.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the \ntiny green moon.\n\nINT.

MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK\n\nLuke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship \nhangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  \nFlight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and \nunlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this \nactivity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes \nonto an armored speeder.\n\nMAN'S VOICE\n(over loudspeaker)\nAll flight trooper, man your stations. \nAll flight troops, man your stations.\n\nHan is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter \npilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of \nhis friend's departure.\n\nLUKE\nSo... you got your reward and you're \njust leaving then?\n\nHAN\nThat's right, yeah! I got some old \ndebts I've got to pay off with this \nstuff. Even if I didn't, you don't \nthink I'd be fool enough to stick \naround here, do you? Why don't you \ncome with us? You're pretty good in \na fight. I could use you.\n\nLUKE\n(getting angry)\nCome on! Why don't you take a look \naround? You know what's about to \nhappen, what they're up against. \nThey could use a good pilot like \nyou. You're turning your back on \nthem.\n\nHAN\nWhat good's a reward if you ain't \naround to use it? Besides, attacking \nthat battle station ain't my idea of \ncourage. It's more like suicide.\n\nLUKE\nAll right. Well, take care of \nyourself, Han. I guess that's what \nyou're best at, isn't it?\n\nLuke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.\n\nHAN\nHey, Luke... may the Force be with \nyou!\n\nLuke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in \na small wave and then goes off.\n\nHan turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,\n\nHAN\nWhat're you lookin' at? I know what \nI'm doing.\n\nINT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP\n\nLuke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.\n\nLEIA\nWhat's wrong?\n\nLUKE\nOh, it's Han! I don't know, I really \nthought he'd change his mind.\n\nLEIA\nHe's got to follow his own path. No \none can choose it for him.\n\nLUKE\nI only wish Ben were here.\n\nLeia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke \nheads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs \nhis arm.\n\nBIGGS\nLuke! I don't believe it! How'd you \nget here... are you going out with \nus?!\n\nLUKE\nBiggs! Of course, I'll be up there \nwith you! Listen, have I got some \nstories to tell...\n\nRed Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up \nbehind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born \nleader.\n\nRED LEADER\nAre you... Luke Skywalker? Have you \nbeen checked out on the Incom T-sixty-\nfive?\n\nBIGGS\nSir, Luke is the best bushpilot in \nthe outer rim territories.\n\nRed Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of \nhis fighter.\n\nRED LEADER\nI met your father once when I was \njust a boy, he was a great pilot. \nYou'll do all right. If you've got \nhalf of your father's skill, you'll \ndo better than all right.\n\nLUKE\nThank you, sir. I'll try.\n\nRed Leader hurries to his own ship.\n\nBIGGS\nI've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll \ntell me your stories when we come \nback. All right?\n\nLUKE\nI told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.\n\nBIGGS\n(going off)\nYou did, all right. It's going to be \nlike old times, Luke. We're a couple \nof shooting stars that'll never be \nstopped!\n\nLuke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for \nhis ship.\n\nAs Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly \nspaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points \nto little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the \nback of the fighter.\n\nCHIEF\nThis R2 unit of your seems a bit \nbeat up. Do you want a new one?\n\nLUKE\nNot on your life! That little droid \nand I have been through a lot \ntogether.\n(to Artoo)\nYou okay, Artoo?\n\nThe crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of \nthe exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps \nthat he is fine.\n\nLuke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an \nhis helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive \nhangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner \ninto Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo \nbeeps good-bye.\n\nCHIEF\nOkay, easy she goes!\n\nTHREEPIO\nHang on tight,Artoo, you've got to \ncome back.\n\nArtoo beeps in agreement.\n\nTHREEPIO\nYou wouldn't want my life to get \nboring, would you?\n\nArtoo whistles his reply.\n\nAll final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  \nThe hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the \npilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The \nhum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted \nvoice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses \nare disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit \nshields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, \nholding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace \nof a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.\n\nBEN'S VOICE\nLuke, the Force will be with you.\n\nLuke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.\n\nEXT.
